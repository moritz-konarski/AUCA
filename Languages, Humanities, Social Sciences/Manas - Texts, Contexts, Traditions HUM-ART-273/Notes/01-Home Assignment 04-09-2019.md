# Readings and Notes - Valikanov

## pp. 2 to pp. 13

### Notes

- The Nogay people have a chieftain, introduced like it is a fundamental truth
- The khan is on his deathbed
- he sends out his companions out to tell everyone what is happening
- a last feast is being prepared
- lots of repetition of the same phrases, e.g. "Nogay teeming as shadows"
- Kotokoy is 199 years old?
- he is Muslim, wants to bedded towards Mecca after his death
- he wishes a celebration, giving away velvet to women and holding a camel race for
  a prize camel
- the khan took in many wanderers of the steppe, man and bird alike and made them
  Nogay
- he passes on the care of the tribe to a warrior, Bay-mirza
- he should be generous with food and even give away his own robe to strangers
- he should also take care of a foundling who may one day become a hero
- make the boy khan when his time has come, says the old khan
- he again repeats phrases, "when my hazel eyes have passed beyond", speaking in
  euphemisms
- khan asks the warrior to leave his forty, a group of trusted companions
- warrior shall leave the khan and seek out Manas, as the khan sees his potential
- by holding a Great Feast, warrior may be freed from his obligation to the khan
- again the "Nogay teeming like shadows at nightfall"
- even the trees weeped as the khan died, so did the Nogay
- the Nogay build a huge mausoleum for the khan, just like he had asked of them
- the horse Kok-ala, ridden by Er-Kokco, son of khans, won the race and was showered with
  gifts
- the warrior does as the khan bade him and holds a feast and cares for men of other
  tribes
- now "Nogay that that turn up their beaver-brims" is repeated
- the warrior did not leave the khan yet, he had to care for the foudling
- the boy went to school and got a saddle with a golden pommel, riding with the Nogay
- the boy, even though the warrior is highly esteemed, wants to take over the reign from
  his adoptive father
- if the warrior disagrees, the boy tells him to go to Manas and to leave him alone
- the boy makes a plan for moving camp to where his fathers feast will be, he repeats in
  essence what his father told the warrior to do
- he will, on his journey, lodge with a rival, infidel khan as if he were his brother
- _he will hold the feast where the khan is laid to rest_
- he will slaughter all the cattle of his father and have 6000 butchers there
- he gathers infidel and muslim in one place, like his father said
- again, the beaver brims, there the boy is made khan by the Nogay

### Observations


## pp. 58 to pp. 61

### Notes

- Manas beat a khan in joust and fighting was about to break out, but Bok-murun bade him to respect the feast
- Khan Bok-murun set out a prize of a black female camel hung with expensive jewelry and
  the like
- a chiftainess strips naked and takes the prize, while the crowd is highly amused
- Manas curses her for taking the camel as she is rich and never had to fear for her life
  for lack of food, accusing her of being greedy
- she retorts, she gave birth to 10 children, one of them named Manas, without her
  thighs, where would the men have come from?
- she says she has enough to get by and that she is in control of her force, which
  enabled her to shame men, whereas she cannot be shamed?

### Notes

- Khan Joloy was killed and his body cremated, such that nothing of him was left to
  bury, then the wind scattered his ashed
- the khan was killed by Manas
- Ac-buudan laments his masters death and the destruction of his body, then to not
  dishonor himself, he walks into the fire

- they fire their __guns__, slaughtering every last man and horse
- one of them fled, Manas set out after them
- Manas recognized the Kitay and pursued him through flooding rivers
- the Kitay's horse was almost submerged
- again the listeners are addressed directly
- Manas gripped the horse's tail and ripped it out, while the steed got away
- the horse laments the death of the heroes and of its tail, wondering what both will
  tell their people when they return, __a talking horse__
- they shall either die or turn around and fight Manas to avenge the dead
- he goes back and tells Manas that they shall fight with all that they have
- the Kitay attacks Manas, hits his helmet/crown
- the battel axes are as broad as yurt doors
- Manas strikes back and puts him to the ground
- again addressing the listeners, as their dear hero Manas does something
- Manas returns, rades with his companions and them returns home
- Manas will go on suffering, his land is big
- again addressing the listeners
- Manas seized the Kalmak and Kitay, stole all the Kazakh's horses
- there are poor people with barely a spear and horse, the Kirgiz
