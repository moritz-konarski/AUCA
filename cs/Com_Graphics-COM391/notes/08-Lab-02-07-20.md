# Notes on the lab 07.02.2020

- today we will work on lab_03
- find the bug and fix it: there should be two triangles on the screen, but
there is only one
- we do we have so many windows and classes? it's inheritance
- bugs:
    - first bug in `es2_constant_material.hpp` -- shader paths were incorrect
    - shared pointer of the triangles line 36 in main, both triangles are in
    the objects class
    - possibly in `es2_renderer.hpp` in ES2Renderer::setup()
