## Grand Manner

- [Wikipedia - Grand manner][Wiki-Grand-manner]
- idealized aesthetic style derived from classicism and High Renaissance
- in 18th century used by British artists to describe paintings with visual
metaphors that suggest noble qualities
- Sir Joshua Reynolds made it popular through lecture at the Royal Academy from
1769 to 1790 -- painters should perceive their subjects through generalization
and idealization and not careful copy of nature
- originally regarding history painting, later also portrait painting
- portraits showed subjects life size and full-length, surroundings conveyed
the nobility and elite status of the subjects
- common background elements: classical architecture (sophistication,
cultivation), pastoral backgrounds (virtuous character, unpretentious, sincere,
undefiled by wealth and estates)
