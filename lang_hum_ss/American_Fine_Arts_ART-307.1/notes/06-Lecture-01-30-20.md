## Romanticism

- American landscape was something new and somethings that set them apart from
Europe
- the US had a ton of land and gave it away cheaply
- there were many trails established that connected the new lands to the east
- manifest destiny was coined and people generally accepted it as right
- together with reminiscence about how the land in the east used to look people
began romanticizing nature
- after 1825 Americans wanted pictures of the land itself because of that
- rich folks often wanted to have pictures that posed a contrast to the cities
and business that they were involved in and armchair travellers could enjoy
themselves

## Thomas Cole
