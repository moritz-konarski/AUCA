## Presentations

My presentation

- I gave my short talk about _New England Scenery_ by Frederic E. Church
- it was not realistic because forests were cut down and stuff changed more
than Church showed $\rightarrow$ Romanticism because it showed an ideal
- not that panoramic (not a lot of detail in the background) and detail is
mostly in the foreground

Anastasiia's presentation

- _Niagara_, 1857
    - highly detailed view from the Canadian side of the Niagara Falls
- _Our Banner in the Sky_, 1861
    - the flag of the north in the Civil War shown in strips of clouds,
    blue/white sky, stars in the sky, tree as mast
    - painting shows sunset, red sky, dark clouds around the edges, dead tree
    as mast $\rightarrow$ shows concern and is not happy, maybe even disturbing
    - shows that he is concerned
- _Cotopaxi_, 1862
    - very red color scheme, shows an erupting volcano
    - this is kind of calm for the thing is shows
    - captured distant places such that Americans could travel
    - religious undertones -- contemplate beautiful nature, God's creations
    - going away -- capture it before it's gone 
- _Winter Twilight from Olana_, 1871
    - work seems not in his style
    - lighting not as epic
    - brushstrokes are visible
    - not really romantic, it sticks out from his usual works

Someone's presentation

- _Thunder Storm on Narragansett Bay_, Martin Johnson Heade, 1868
- there may be some similarities to Cole's _Voyage of Life_ because of the
darkness
- shows a coastal area with the workers, fishermen, boats 
- a couple are taking their boat ashore 
- period of depression that does not last long
- play of light and darkness from front to back and left to right
- nobody is running, it is not that fearsome, they are used to it
- great reflections on the water 
- many colored painting, experiment in color according to Hardin

## Notes

- Church changed his style from Luminism through Romanticism to something that
clearly shows brush strokes 
- _Vision of the Cross_ was created as a reaction to his travels to the Holy
Land, where he also paints Jerusalem from afar
- another _Cotopaxi_ because he was interested in natural phenomena

-------------------

- _The Shore of the Turquoise Sea_, Albert Bierstadt, 1878 is different from
his other paintings
- it does not show plains or mountains or valleys
- like Cole, he showed human influence through a broken mast, oars, etc

----------------------

- _Autumn - On the Hudson River_, Jasper Francis Cropsey, 1860 is super
luminist in his depiction of the nature

------------------------

- Bierstadt is was not afraid of including native americans in his paintings,
but in some cases just to give some context to the size of the things he
painted
- Bierstadt mostly painted the American West, Church travelled far and wide and
painted South America, Cole mostly painted Hudson river stuff
- they all wanted to show a panoramic view of significant landscapes

-----------------------

- _Fur Traders Descending the Missouri_, George Caleb Bingham, 1845, is
a luminist painting in style with a big sky and a lot of light and generally
calm subjects
- the young man is half native, his father is French, they have a small black
bear on the boat, a shot duck on the boat and the young native is stretched out
on a rifle
- the US produced fur for the European market
- the America of wilderness, which is gone forever now, is shown in this
picture
