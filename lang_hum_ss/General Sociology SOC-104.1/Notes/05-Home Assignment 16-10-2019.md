# Anybody's Son Will Do - Gwynne Dyer

- the socializing of men from normal members of society into soldier/killer
  roles has been institutionalized through the centuries
- all soldiers anytwhere are ultimately the same
- they are also different from almost anyone else, as they have to be, they do
  stuff no human should have to do -- killing and dying
- basic training is responsible for this socialization, and it is pretty much
  the same everywhere, as young men tend to be the same everywhere
- young boys recall the values that tribal warriors once held??
- as modern societies didn't just appear, they developed gradually, so it is no
  surprise that there is still a lot of stuff left from those times
- this can still be seen in a lot of facets of male standards
- the transformation can start in puberty or before in militarized societies
- in most modern societies this process starts later and is more concentrated
  -> basic training
- this thing is more about emotions than about specific ideas
- the ideas that soldiers fight and die for don't really matter
- they fight for priests, kings, politicians all the same
- the men in the trenches fight for more basic motives, higher motives may be
  found in the command structure or the ruling elite
- they pay lip service to symbols and values, even though they know that that
  is not what matters, even though soldiers may believe in these things
  themselves
- what enables men to fight is their own self-respect and a special kind of
  love
- they generally chose to die for themselves and for each other
- what creates these values is basic training, which is so effective and normal
  that we fail to realize how remarkable it is
- the initial phase of basic is not really about learning how to be a soldier,
  but about changing their values and loyalties
- the most important quality of teenagers is that they are naivete and
  enthusiasm
- the army also provides something the young recruits want, discipline and
  a structured environment
- for young Marine Corps recruits, they are worn out and disoriented before the
  training even begins
- the whole system is set up that it can almost certainly convert anyone within
  3 months
- the army is kind of analogous to a rite of passage, maybe the closest thing
  to it that still exists
- the recruits need to be "motivated", they can then do things that they would
  have never dreamt of
- the first 3 days are forming, where recruits have to surrender all the things
  that still connect them to their civillian life: hair, clothes, other
  personal belongings
