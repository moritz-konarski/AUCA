# The Second Sex - Simone de Beauvoir

## Preface

- the author argues that women's higher education should be on one level with
  that of men
- some American colleges do that already; others lack professional training as
  a result of that
- "femininity" is seen as weak as a result of this difference in education
- the style is precise, sometimes poetic and elevated; 
- this is based on existentialism, translator had to add some notes on their
  terminology
- there has been almost no editing, except for the names of a couple of people
  that are alive at the time, such that they may not get sued

## Introduction

- she waited a long time to write a book about women, as the subject is
  irritating, especially to women; it's also not new
- quarreling over feminism, no more shall be said about it
- what is the problem then?
- the eternal feminine: "even in Russia, women are still women"
- "women are losing their way, they are lost"
- what place do women occupy in this world? What should their place be?
- What is a woman? "woman is a womb" say some, but then some people claim that
  certain women are not women
- women exist as the female half of the human species; yet femininity is said
  to be in danger
- they are told to be women, become women, stay women: not every female human
  is a women it seems; she must share "femininity"
- does it come from the uterus? From philosophy? There is no real definition of
  it, the terms used to describe it are like the ones seers use 
- this is no longer the scientifically accepted view, there is always
  a situation at play
- does woman have any specific content? some say that women are just human
  beings; but women are still different from men in certain ways
- attitude of defiance is a sign that women are haunted by their own femininity
- it is obvious that women and men are different, one just needs to take a walk
  to see that; whatever their reasons, they are most definitely present
- if there is no eternal feminine, if female biology is not enough, then we
  need to state what women is
    - first, no one would write a book on the situation of the human male
    - men and women do not have equal standing, as can be seen from the term
      "man" used to describe all humans
    - men are in the right, women are wrong in essence
    - men regard their own perception to be objective, while women are regarded
      as subjective 
    - female is a female by the _lack_ of qualities; made from a bone Adam
      didn't need
    - woman is defined as relative to man; he is the subject, she the other
    - otherness is a fundamental category of human thought
- thus no group sets themselves up as the one without also setting up the other
  is some way
- consciousness is hostility towards any other consciousness; subjects can only
  be posed in being opposed by something; so men take women to be the other
- in most other cases though, when groups come together they realize that they
  are each other's other and that makes the whole concept relative
- why did this not happen with women and men? 
    - no subject will voluntarily become the object
    - the other does not define itself, it is defined as such by the one
    - the other has be submissive enough to accept the status
- where does the submission of women come from?
    - oftentimes submission is the result of inferior numbers, but with women
      this is not the case
    - women were never a minority or a separated group of mankind
    - women have always been subordinate to men, so there was no time when this
      started, thus it can be hard to grasp that it will ever end
    - women don't say "We", they use the same title that men gave them, women
    - other oppressed groups say we, thus transforming themselves into the one
      and the oppressor into the other
    - women have also never achieved more than symbolic agitation
    - they have only taken what men gave them instead of taking something
    - they lack a common history or anything that could form them into
      a collective unit
    - they don't have history, religion, similar living situation of their own, nothing that really
      generates solidarity
    - they are attached to men through residence, housework, economics, social
      standing -- the bonds to her oppressor are stronger than any others
    - women are the other in a totality where both parts are necessary to one
      another
- one might suggest that this reciprocity would benefit women, but it does not,
  not even the satisfaction of sexual needs is good enough
- the mutual need always tends to work in favor of the oppressor
- women have always man's dependant
- laws are generally in favor of the man, economically there are almost two
  castes etc
- women would also be disadvantaged if they broke the liege with men, they'd
  lose the stuff men provide: material protection, moral justification
- women don't claim subject status because of lacking resources, a necessary
  bond tying her to man regardless of reciprocity, and being quite comfortable
  with the subject status
- why have men won dominion over women? Why has is always been this way?
    - men have always been judge and party in one, so their opinion is pretty
      biased, they also quite like being superior
    - male intellectuals have always striven to justify this superiority and
      enshrine it in religion and law
    - "it is easier to accuse one sex than to excuse the other", the weakness
      of women is a welcome thing to attack
    - women's rules are laid down for them by men so it is no wonder that they
      reject them
    - when emancipation became more realistic during the industrialization, old
      morals were dusted off and weaponized like never before to keep women in
      check as emancipation became a realistic option now
    - emancipation is granted in part to still be able to control the process
    - the argumentation is often circular: women are made to be powerless
      and then their powerlessness is taken as a reason to keep it that way
- women today are inferior. Should that change?
    - many men hope that it will continue: feeling superior is nice; even if
      you are at the very bottom, there is always someone there that you can
      spit on
    - it is also difficult to just give up being the subject
    - abstract notions of equality and inequality are taken to fit both
      arguments for and against equality: pro gives abstract equality and
      chalks up inequality to nature; contra gives actual inequality and then
      derives abstract inequality from that
