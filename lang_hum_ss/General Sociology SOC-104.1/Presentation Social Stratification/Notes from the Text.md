# The Uses of Global Poverty: How Economic Inequality Benefits the West

## Introduction

- the authors argue that global poverty benefits the rich nations of the world
- people are aware of the huge wealth disparity between countries
- most people also recognize that this disparity is negative, as wealth
  influences education, health care, consumption
- Why that is the case is not so clearly agreed upon
- the authors use GNI PPP as a comparison factor between countries' wealth
- the global system is characterized by massive maldistribution of wealth,
  economic security, purchasing power -> __fundamental stratification__
- how have the wealthy states responded to this stratification?
- rhetoric has focused on spreading wealth from the west to the rest of the
  world
- G. Bush advocated for this in 1989, connecting it to the spread of western
  values and institutions
- authors say that, except for minute progress, we did not achieve this goal
  yet, mostly stuff is as it used to be
- the rhetoric has not changed either, B. Clinton has said basically the same
  thing as Bush
- the new Bush has not yet done this, but they guess he will
- this rhetoric seems to suggest a focus on extending the wealth to the 1.3
  billion who live on less that $1 a day plus all those just above that
- how can we explain this disparity? Why does it exist?

## Lit review, background

- this article is based on a 1971 article by H. Gans "The Uses of Poverty: The
  Poor Pay All"
- he used a conservative theoretical perspective in sociology, functionalism,
  to inquire about inequality in America
- functionalism: all elements of society have some function in a society, i.e.
  they contribute something to it
- if they would not contribute something to society, they would disappear (from
  the functionalist perspective)
- functions can be manifest (obvious) or latent (hidden)
- assumption is that stuff exists because it has some function -> What is that
  function?
- following, Gans asked: What are the uses of poverty?
- poverty being functional to society as a whole is kinda ludicrous, as it's
  not functional to those experiencing it
- so there must be a smaller part, interest groups and other aggregates existing in a social system, who benefit from poverty
- Gans suspected that few phenomena are functional for society as a whole, most
  only for certain groups, while costing others
- so he looked at poverty from the perspective of how it benefits the nonpoor
  (anyone from the nonpoor classes, not just obvious exploiters)
- he found 13 "uses" of poverty, e.g. there will be someone to do the dirty
  work, someone to purchase goods no one with a choice would, they make good
  scapegoats to uphold the social norms
- he argued that the poor have positive social functions for the nonpoor
- thus, eliminating poverty would actually cost the nonpoor

## The authors' approach

- the same question Gans asked about the US might be asked about the world at
  large
- What are the uses of global poverty for the better-off countries
- this is supposed to create a deeper understanding of why is continues to
  exist
- this is done by explaining how it benefits the inhabitants of well-off states



# To investigate

- did the lip-service continue?
- how did the GNI PPP develop? Compare the growth
- how many people live in absolute poverty? more than 1.3 bio probably
- how does Gans's view fit into functionalism?
-
