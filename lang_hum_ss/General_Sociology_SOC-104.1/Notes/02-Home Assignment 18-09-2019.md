# Sociological Imagination Excerpt (C. Wright Mills, 1959)

## Notes

- people feel that they are trapped in their private lives
- like they __cannot__ overcome their troubles
- that is often true, as they are bound bey the orbits they live in
- they are limited to/by job, family, neighborhood
- in other millieus they are like spectators
- the more they realize that there are threats, ambitions taht are outside of
  their immediate surroundings, the more trapped they feel
- _e.g. the threat of losing your job because your company gets bought by
  another, something you can do nothing about_
- this sense of being trapped comes from impersonal changes to the structure of
  continent-wide societies
- history is the sum of individual experiences (success and failure)
- _e.g. during war, a store clerk becomes a RADAR man_
- __neither the life of an individual nor the history of a society can be
  understood without understanding both__
- still, people don't tend to connect their own personal troubles to the bigger
  picture (world history, etc)
- people lack the 'quality of mind' to grasp this interplay of man and society,
  self and world
- people cannot cope with with personal troubles in ways that control the
  structural transformations that usually cause them
- no wonder, as today there is more change faster than ever before
- in one generation, on sixth of mankind transformed from feudal, backwards to
  modern, advances, fearful
- colonies became independent, imperialism became less visible, revolutions
  occur, new kinds of authority emerge, totalitarian societies arise (fail or
  succeed), capitalism rose, even just formal democracy is only for a small
  portion of mankind
- global superpowers prepare for WWIII
- the shaping of history outpaces the ability of men to orient themselves in
  accordance with cherished values
- even those values are changing, collapsing, new ones are arising
- no wonder people cannot cope with worlds that confront them so suddenly
- they cannot understand the meaning of the current time for their own lives
- this leads to moral insensibility, as a mechanism of protection, to a feeling
  of being trapped
- they need information (Age of Fact), as it dominates and overwhelms their
  capabilities to deal with it
- _they need more than reason, they need a quality of mind that will help them
  to use information and to develop reason in order to achieve lucid summation
  of what is going on the world and of what may be happening within
  themselvesi_ -> __Sociological Imagination__
- __Sociological Imagination enables people to understand the larger historical
  scene in terms of its meaning for the inner life and the external carrer of
  individuals__
- within this confusing mess, people look for a framwork for society, within
  which psychologies are formulated
- this helps focus on troubles and leads to public engagement
- first derivative is the idea that an individual can understand their
  experience and gauge their fate only by becoming aware of all the individuals
  in their position and locating themselves within their period
- people contribute to the shaping of their society and to history, even though
  in small amounts, even if society made them by 'push and shove'
- SI enables us to grasp history and biography and the relations between the
  two within society
- this is both a task and a promise, one which many great sociologists have
  fulfilled, it is the signal of what is best in contemporary study of man and
  society
- all social studies that have risen to this promise have asked three kinds of
  questions:
    1. What is the structure of society? What are its components and their
       relations? Where does this society stand in history? How is it changing?
       What is its meaning for the development for humanity?
    2. How is that which we examine related to its historical period? What are
       the features of this period? What makes this period unique? How is it
       making histor?
    3. What kind of people prevail in this society? What might prevail in the
       future? How are they shaped? What does this reveal about 'human nature'?
       What kind of rule does it play?
- regardless of the subject, these are the kinds of questions good social
  analysts ask
- they are pivotal to to studies of man and society, and inevitably raised by
  anyone that uses sociological imagination
- SI enables one to switch perspectives from one to the other, from political
  to psychological
- meaning to see the realtions from the most impersonal and remote
  transfomations and the most intimate features of the human self
- this is why socioogical imagination is a hope for grasping the world and in
  themselves
- SI is the most fruitful form of self-consciousness, it gives the feeling that
  one can now find some answers and orientation
- _by their reflection and by their sensibility, they realize the cultural
  meaning of the social sciences_
