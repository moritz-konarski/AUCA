## pp 58-61

### Notes

- Manas wins the joust and injures an infidel, a fight is about to break out as he tries
  to take his horse
- Bok-murun asks him to respect the feast and not to fight
- the infidel gets a gift from Bok-murun
- the next day Bok-murun put a prize of a barren black camel with a lot of tapestry for
  the crowd, a woman chieftain strips down and takes the camel while the crowd is highly
  amused
- Manas curses her for taking the camel, as she is in a good situation and never had to
  go hungry
- she retorts that she has given birth to 10 sons and that she fought for what she has
- Manas can not shame her, but she regularly shames men with her power?
- in l. 2137 there is some text missing?, it was underlined
- in l. 2165, something was crowded in at the left margin, something overwritten
- "-- dedi" is for almost the entire page may mean "said"??, continues on the next page, from 2155 it's "-- dol'ay"
- rhyme schemes where entire words are repeated

### Observations

- Manas apparently had to go poor and hungry for some time
- feasts are respected, as their shall be no fighting
- the camel is described as something of utmost beauty and desire
- Hatto notes that the bard uses many foreign words
- the whole passage is traditional, according to Hatto and the bard either ironic in his
  description or ironic, like questioning if she really is a woman or not
- the chieftain boasts that she gave birth to many heroes, so she deserves respect
- she wins a game where a woman strips naked and unties a camel from a stake that is low
  in the ground
- "dol'ay" is apparently an ejaculation of disapproval
- a passage mentions the river Merke as a sign of beauty, V. had only traversed this
  river a week before the performance
- the heroes the chieftain claims to have born are all older than Manas, well
  established, some are infidels, some are Muslim

## pp 82-89

- the passage starts after the scribe stopped writing for an unknown amount of time
- again the repetition of "-- dedi" at the end of phrases
- words were erased/corrected in the manuscript, some have been entirely lost
- the khans body was destroyed, his companion laments this breach of tradition
- he is indebted to his master, walks into the flames as a sacrifice to save his honor
- Manas' companions (Solto clan war cries) slaughter infidels with guns
- Manas pursues Konur-bay of the Kitay, ripping out the horses tail
- the horse talks to the Kitay, telling him what they could say to their people when they
  return in dishonor
- the horse urges him to turn around and fight or die
- they turn around and face Manas
- the Kitay tells Manas that they will fight till death, with all that they have, even
  axes as broad as yurt doors
- Kitay attacks, hits Manas, but does no damage, Manas strikes back and kills him
- he return to his companions, raiding with them
- Manas will go on suffering, there is no help for him
- Manas plundered all kinds of tribes, the Kirgiz as well, who are describes as poor
- he also fought the Koqand Khanate, and their ruler, an Ozbek
- addressing the listeners, they shall not give offense and clatter their spears, or
  their women will go barren
- then a blessing is asked for Manas, may he have good thins in the future

### Observations

- it was custom to bury a khan, cremating him is an offense
- companions would resort to suicide to not dishonor their names
- Manas companions indiscriminately killed civilians, had guns
- a horse can talk??
- Manas is a ferocious warrior, killing his opponent with a single blow
- Manas goes on to fight and plunder many different tribes
- what the storyteller says seems to enrage some of the warriors that are present
- then the storyteller asks for a blessing for Manas, as to keep the story going for next
  time

## pp 163-173

### Notes

- Khan Kokotoy is ill and dying
- he sends for Bok-murun and all his people
- when all were assembled, he dies
- Bok-murun now calls five young friends and tells them:
  - we shall give a proper feast
  - go and invite the heroes to the feast
  - I shall give prizes beyond measure
  - if the hero Er Kosoy does not come, I shall raze his yurt
  - also go and invite Manas, who is described unfavorably again
  - go and invite Er Agis, Er Tostuk, Urbu, Kok-koyon and a host of other people
- many repetitions of the phrase "When you ride on thence ... find him and bring the news"
- he also invites infidels to his feast
- the companions rode out to all corners of the earth and summoned the guests
- Bok-murun asks his companions how he shall conduct the feast, win a place in the Next
  World, where to hold the feast etc.
- another description of a journey to the feast, maybe another annual nomad trip?
- now Manas is invited by the herald, he finds him playing chess atop a mountain,
  losing it
- Manas goes into rage, his companions try to restrain him
- Manas tells them how to cruelly kill the messenger, which they do by galloping over him
  in turn
- Manas has nice things, a pavilion of camel hair etc. and he vows to profane the
  memorial feast of Kokotoy Khan
- when looking at the land Manas sees clouds of dust at a city and wonders if there is
  war, he orders his companions to saddle up to investigate

### Observatoins

- again the storyteller uses the same phrases over and over
- the feast is, like in V., supposed to entertain a huge host of people
- Manas gets a lot more time in the story this time around, how he was invited is really
  described in detail
- he is still not described as a hero, but kind of ugly, but not as bad as in V., still
  he is called Tiger-born, which I'd take as a compliment
- he is still a hothead, and brutally murders the herald that came to invite him to the
  feast
- he furthermore vows to profane the feast, which seems like a breach of traditions

## pp 183-189

- here the horse race was described, which seems like a giant long race, taking months
  and ranging for hundreds of kilometers
- Bok-murun now inspects the racers, when Konur-bay comes forth and demands Maniker, his
  horse under threat of war, to raze entire hordes
- Bok-murun will hold council with the people to decide whether or not to give up the
  horse
- elder Kosoy tells Bok to wait and consult Manas whether or not to hand over the horse
- Manas tells him how he fought like a hero at 6, and a khan demanded his horse
- some story that doesn't fit?
- then Manas says that today he demands Maniker, tomorrow another horse, and then he will
  demand all race horses
- Manas fought Konur-bay before and won, so why wouldn't he win now?
- Manas rode off, with his 40 companions in tow, asking Bok-murun is there is a reason to
  give the horse away?

### Observations

- Manas seems to be respected enough by Bok-murun's tribe that an elder tells him to ask
  for his input
- Bok-murun forgave the brutal killing of his messenger?
- otherwise not sure how this connects without context

## pp 201

### Notes

- now Bok-murun put treasure into a pit and tied a camel in front of it, whoever unties
  it gets the prize
- Orongu started doing it, naked
- a Muslim approaches Manas and asks to assist Orongu to share the winnings, Manas allows
  it
- they divide them between them, Manas tells Almambet to tell the other not to insult the
  khan Orongu, he wants to behave as princes do. Give her a horse and something to cover
  herself
- now Almambet insults Orongu's appearance and haphazardly throws a cloak over her
- Orongu won the prize

### Observations

- the same kind of super personal insults that Manas made in V. are used by one of his
  companions in R.
- Manas behaves better, telling his companion to cover her and honor her as khan, which
  he doesn't really do
- the shift from who says what is interesting, while what is said remains the same
- it puts Manas in a better light, sure, but why nor remove the insults all together
  then?

## pp 217-236

### Notes

- Khan Joloy is injured and his medic tells him not to ride out, but he ignores him
- he calls for his men to assemble and the medic warns him again not to ride out
- Joloy plans to have a big slaughter, being very sick
- Manas is already waiting for him
- Manas addresses his men as the army nears: we shall attack them from behind, while
  Manas plans an ambush in wooded land
- a description of the army is repeated here
- there was ferocious fighting, but khan Joloy was nowhere to be found
- the he came in behind, not finding anyone to fight
- Targil-taz tells Joloy they will be defeated, he should not go on as he sees Manas
  waiting
- Joloy splits his chin in rage and gallops away
- Joloy is a ferocious warrior, none can stand is his path, except Manas, who impales
  him on his lance, but Joloy is still standing. Then Almambek impales him too and throws
  him to the ground
- Manas then decapitates Joloy with his sword
- Almambek fights the sons of Joloy in gory fashion
- the sons got killed and many others routed
- at the break of dawn they plan to descend on Joloy people and give his daughters to the
  smith and his son
- Manas tells the companions that he brought them their weapons and now expects them to
  fight, less their lives be forfeit and their cattle up for pillaging
- he wants them to die for his sake, if they flee, he will kill them himself
- they have guns, which is totally unexpected
- they slaughtered the people of Joloy and stole his daughters
- Manas rides home saying that his shame is ended now, he takes one of the khan's
  daughters and gives the others to the craftsman as booty
- Manas took three wives, now his father inspects them
- one of them is not lucky, he states
- one is cursed, the third one he considers lucky and a good leader/warrior
- Kanikey is the famed one that his father approves of
- he tells his companions to get ready to go to Kanikey at dawn, to see if his father is
  right
- Kanikey orders one of her maids to open the door and the other one to take care of
  Manas' horse
- they plan to treat the companions and Manas with the highest honor when they arrive
- the procedure is repeated twice
- she clothes them in the most exquisite of garments, much to their amazement
- the companions are well pleased
- after some camping, to not become soft, Manas set out to raid the Kalmak, who seem to
  be rich
- Manas saddles up, but Kanikey bids him to stay as this year and month are unlucky
- the same kind of warning was given to khan Joloy before his demise
- he goes into a rage and whips her so hard her clothes rip open
- Kanikey starts _laughing_ at this and tells him to restrain himself and wishes him good
  luck with his raiding and a swift return
- Manas leaves, but Akilay, following Kanikey, takes hold of him and tells him the same
  exact thing
- again, he goes into a rage, calls her a wretch and tells her that he didn't take
  Kanikey's advice, so why should he take hers?
- he whips her too, ripping her gown and scattering her jewelry, she curses him in return
- she curses him to never come back and never hold Kanikey again
- Kanikey, who can see the future, sends a messenger after him telling him to come back,
  but Manas can't listen to a woman, so he does not come back

### Observations

- the Kirgiz are superficially islamicized according to Hatto
- Joloy was poisoned and still put up an admirable fight against Manas' companions
- he was then killed by two lance thrusts and decapitation
- Manas companions are fiercely loyal and Manas expects them to be too
- Manas raids Joloy's land and steals his daughters
-
