# The dual between Manas and Kokco re: religion

## Notes

- tiger image and "like god above"
- a bunch of Czar boot-licking
- Manas made the guy that God's own lips called "Son" submit
- Almambet will become companions with a Sultan of the Nogay
- Manas again fights all but the Padisha
- the czar tells him the exact stuff the poet has been saying the whole time,
  repeating all that stuff ad nauseam
- live a good life and God will reward you, says the totally muslim czar
- he was made powerful by God, he spreads his crecend borws, haha symbolism (he
  showed clemency??)
- the czar really likes Manas and talks like a nomad
- Jakip rides out to find a good bride for Manas
- he has a formulaec exchange with a shepherd about how Manas provides for him
- Whitebeard as an alias of the czar
- the shepard slaughters his best sheep in Jakip's honor
- he then tells him about Kanikey and the whole family situation
- crescent-moon-jeweled horse of Jakip-bay -> symblism
- Jakip found no beauty anywhere else, so now he is here
- Kalmak are so infidel that they tie pig's legs to their horses
- Manas is blessed by God
- Mendi-bay is outraged that Jakip shows up empty-handed asking for Kanikey
- he wants Jakip beaten for this insult
- Manas is so mighty that the khan fears him, he could destroy all the great
  heroes around
- he bades his warriors treat Jakip with utmost respect, the next day they
  shall talk and see 
- Jakip is pretty explicit about Kanikey's beauty
- Temir answers that Manas is known to be a quarrelsome fellow, while Kanikey
  is comically pure, to the point of ridiculousness
- if Manas stops his break-neck lifestyle, he will get his daughter, otherwise
  not as Temir does not want to see her grieve
- Jakip is not amuse, threatens that Manas will take her by forces anyways, the
  czar gave him all people (except russians) and he will destroy you
- Temir is frightened and claims to have made a joke, goes and consults his
  wife, daughter and seniors
- Mendi-bay complains about the non-existant gifts, then claims he'd kill Manas
- the entaurage tells him to shut up, they are afraid of Manas
- a random boar image appears
- they get Jakip and treat him like a khan
- now they suggest and offer Jakip should bring 
- Manas is again compared to God, he prepares the gift for Temir
- Manas first goes and counsels with the czar, who approves
- the czar uses the same kind of left/right seating as a yurt would have
- he give Manas coin to give a gifts to the in-laws
- Manas swears by God
- Mendi-bay tries to start a war with Manas and Temir khan
- Manas is left outside while the 40 companions are invited into a yurt
- Manas laments being an only-child, no brothers to look after him
- the companions realize their error and gallop back in disarray and fear,
  Manas might kill them for what they did
- Manas basically bribes the kinswomen of Kanikey
- he goes to Kanikey's yurt, being the first man to ever be there
- he ate her food, drank her kumys, undoes her buttons (80) and slips into her
  bed
- Kanikey is a virgin, it is signaled all over
- Manas proceeds to rape the sleeping Kanikey
- Kanikey sits up and draws her dagger, proceeding to ask him who he is
- Manas says he brought the gifts, so he is no stranger here
- she humiliates him, not recognizing who he is
- he insults her back, calling her spoilt etc
- she then slashes his forearm and calves
- he threatens to harm her, making her a shepard or something, for that he will
  go raiding to get the herds for that
- Manas calls her a shrew, her mother also calls her spoilt
- Kanikey interrupts them and tells them she wants to find out what kind of man
- the yurt of Manas is floating??
- Manas vows to fight his father?
- the companions attack Temir khan and Jakip khan
- now Temir khan's people want to go and hand over Kanikey to make the fighting
  stop
- K is noble, so she will not be troubled by the Companions, she will do it
  herself
- Manas sees the maidens and plans to seize them as booty to punish Kanikey
- he wants to put her on the horse without a saddle
- Manas asks her if she has come to her senses?
- there are shapeshifting maidens in this __not very muslim__
- Almambet is the best of the companions, he would be worth while Altinay
- Atinay should try to get Almambet
- Mendi-bay wants to not give maidens to Manas and wants to kill him for what
  he did
- Mendi-bay does listen to Temir khan, but only if he is threatened
