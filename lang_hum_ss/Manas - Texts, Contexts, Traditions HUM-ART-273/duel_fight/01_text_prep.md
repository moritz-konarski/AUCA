- Hatto's take on the story:
    - this bard is different from others
    - the submission to the Czar is always there
    - bards were prepared to infuse propaganda
    - oral epics always have a political dimension
    - we don't know is this performance was one-on-one or with others
    - the passages (money for the relatives of Kanikey...) it seems like more
      than just a quick attempt
    - Manas is honored by the Czar as a great conqueror
- submission right at the start (pp. 77-79):
    - he rides like no grass grows
    - fights so that no one can wage war on him
    - he held a feast for the nobles, here Manas submitted to him
    - Manas was handed food by the Czar (same phrase as in Jantay's funeral
      lament) -> same pharse used when he submits to the Koqand Khanate
    - Manas was a great warrior, ruling huge swaths of land
    - Czar and Manas were on level terms: could mean honest terms
    - Manas does not make war on the Russians
    - Manas lead all people, except Russians
    - all but the Russians submitted to Manas
    - nobody would stand against Manas, but he still submitted
    - he even gave him gifts of honor
    - __even day and night are in fear of Manas__ (first para p. 79) still he
      submitted
    - Manas wants to give Kokco's racer to the Czar
    - the Czar personally counsels Manas, a great honor
    - Manas is under the protection of the Czar
- p. 85:
    - Czar is invoked as a friend during Manas travel in the underworld
    - same as his 40 companions
    - the Czar is mentioned first, right after god -> super high status
- p. 91-93:
    - after the fight with Kokco, Manas goes to counsel with the Padishah
    - he tells the Czar how he will conquer all these different people
    - pleads with him not to be angry
    - he prepares a meal for the Russians (with hairy mouths)
    - image of Tiger-like padisha
    - knout for striking, rides away the grass
    - Czar tells him not to offend his people
    - he repeats a saying that sounds like that of Kokotoy khan before he dies:
      give poor people a cloak, a horse etc.
    - the Czar is wishing him well with Islamic phrases
    - Czar credits god for making him great
    - Manas stops raiding because of him
- p. 97:
    - Jakip-bay invokes the White Padishah's blessing often when arriving at
      Kanikey's tribe to drive home the point that he and his son are not to be
      messed with
- p. 105:
    - Jakip again invokes the Czar to pressure Temir into giving him his
      daughter, or else
    - the czar gave manas all but the Russians, so watch out
    - also Temir expects the Czar to give Manas money
- p. 109:
    - Manas goes to the Czar for counseling regarding his wedding
- p. 111:
    - the czar approves of Manas marriage
    - has companions on the right, senators on the left
    - has them open saddle bags
    - Manas shall give gold and silver to his in-laws
- p. 115:
    - the story of how Manas got the gold is told
- p. 121:
    - Czar gave counsel to manas: look how important the guy is
- p. 131:
    - when Manas dies, he tells his companions to submit to the Czar
    - the czar only gives, is extremely generous
    - this is the last command Manas gives to his companions
- p. 153:
    - after Manas comes back to life, Manas remembers how the Czar blessed him
    - it's one of the first things he remembers
- p. 157:
    - all the companions settle on rivers
    - Manas rules over all except for the Ak-padishah's people
    - he did not clash with the White padisha at all
    - the padishah acted as a mediator in times when that was needed
    - Czar first said: Look to Manas!
    - then he counseled: do not fight the other peoples
    - after the blessing by the padishah, Manas had no more trouble, he could
      fulfill all his desires
- interesting notes:
    - the Czar is only mentioned is some very specific sections -> later
      addition? only modified certain sections?
    - with all this boastful talk about Manas it seems like the part about
      submission was added later, as it does not fit in
    - the Czar is treated like a khan would be, in description as well as
      action -> suggests the bard didn't know about how the Czar acted, only
      that he was super powerful (inspite of their generally excellent
      awareness of history of the region)
    - the Czar is apparently held in very high esteem: maybe because of
      voluntary annexation, would the south have told a different Manas at the
      time
    - the Czar is freaking far away, so counseling with him is a thing of
      months, it's not quickly done. This could be due to the epic, but also
      because the bard did not realize how far away (>4000 km), it is mentioned
      that Manas was gone for 3 months, so maybe it's realistic
    - p. 93 again imagery from the world of khans
    - the Czar is a muslim khan
    - the Czar gets Manas to stop raiding
    - the czar only appears only in certain sections, but he is always
      mentioned as a figure of power
    - the czar is known to be rich, Temir wants his gold
    - did the Czars buy the tribes before, to be known for their money?
    - Manas last words are him telling his companions that they should submit
      to the Czar, a pretty clear sign of his devotion/love of the czar
    - the Czar is almost a divine figure watching over Manas and protecting him
    - the Czar only acts three to four times in the whole text, all of those acts are benevolent towards Manas
    - __The Czar is almost like a benevolent Khan-God that watches over Manas__
- summary:
    - Czar is more of a Khan
    - he is muslim
    - he is all-powerful
    - he is rich
    - Czar is powerful like god that you do not want to anger
    - the bard seems obsessed with the Russian Czar
    - the Czar could be easily replaced by any other Khan-God character that
      the bard fancied
    - there probably was a switch at some point, where some other great Khan
      was replaced by the Czar
    - if it was a new addition, the czar only appears a couple of times, the
      other times only his blessing is mentioned or his power invoked -> adding
      him to the story can't have been that difficult
- theses:
    - the czar replaced an earlier khan figure in the story
    - the bard added it to appease the new overlords
    - he was just obsessed with the czar
    - the bard was hoping for the czar to become to them what he was for manas
