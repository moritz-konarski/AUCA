When Manas became Manas when Manas attained name and fame when he bestraddled his steed and rode on distant journeys he alarmed this World and terrified men one and all - at a repast set for feasting he submitted to him called the White Padishah’ He who rides so that no grass grows who fights so that none can wage war on him the White Padishah set a repast for his noble people to feast at (and here) the warrior Manas submitted to the White Padishah’ A sash-of-honour had been wound round Manas’s waist and he had become the White Padishah’s subject - he had swallowed the food he had handed down to him - Manas kept all his commands I have spread Ak-kula’s mouth wide I have holed smoke-vent covers with my spear cut down door-lintels with my sword I have razed strongholds built of stone punched holes beyond number into sand-built forts I have seized those maidens with their crane-feathers as booty taken them by their gleaming wrists and thrust them behind the saddle Manas struck terror into the gibbering Manchu he ruled the Land of the Clouds’ - Warrior Manas held sway over all that the sun’s rays shine on When he donned a gleaming corselet it had a sleeve the one called the White Padishah’ and Manas were on level terms Mounting Ak-kula Manas did not trot he did not come and make war on the Russians The war-horse rounded up his herd Manas led those people - apart from Russians - into his counsels Going out to the White Hill of Counsel they struck the stone; those people - other than Russians - came to Manas and banged their heads in submission On reedy soil there stands no almond-tree - nor is there a man who would gainsay Manas He had thrown Joloy down on to the path - you Manas had lanced sheer-nosed Kogur-bay of the Kitay clean through when beginning your faltering life You churned the Sart people put the Galcha people to flight tormented the Kizil-bas people You went to the White Padishah and made him gifts of honour On the Red Standard-with-white-streamers you helved white pennants and at the head of your Forty Companions shouted to Ajibay called to Almambet His sword is at his wrist Manas’s herohood is in his heart when his heart impels him to attack when the Forty roll up their sleeves The flower the very pick of heroes of any kind heroes though they were had no recourse they never struck back at Manas with their ashes When he rides a racer he does not trot No man comes straight before the warrior Manas - even the moon goes in fear of his radiance the sun in dread of his refulgence they hide themselves behind the clouds The steed he rides is Ak-kula the corselet he dons is Ak-kubo No horse overtakes Ak-kula no shot passes through Ak kubo The horse ridden under the lash is Kara-ker the path under his hooves is the dark earth - Manas having become Manas having attained name and fame no horse overtakes Ak-kula no shot passes through Ak-kubo You mounted your steed Er Manas thinking I shall let only grass grow where he rides I shall make war on Er Kokco I shall strike the White Tiger and strike again come summer I shall make work-horses of Kokco’s herds of varied coats I shall come and drive his teeming foals to water I shall thrust his neighing stallions out to the wild beasts shall come and milk his whinnying mares that have no sucking foals Though Kokco’s men come in serried ranks I shall thrust them down single-handed I shall make his corselet my corselet make his steed a work-horse treating my steed to his fodder At the feast of the White Padishah I shall present him with Kokco’s racer Kuroncu I shall give each horse with its bridle I shall go with all that the White Padishah has said In summer there is great refulgence - when the White Padishah has spoken his counsels to me where is he that will gainsay me The game I lie in wait for is the mountain-ram younger or full-grown all that divide the hoof - the White Padishah is loftier than Ala-too When the White Padishah has spoken his counsels where will there be any man to strike his lash at Manas My steed Ak-kula has eaten his fill When I have come under the protection of the White Padishah there will be none who will quarrel with me for he is warrior Manas’s Protector Pillowing my head on the snow I found herds - Kanikey should take pleasure in that I thought Pillowing my head on the ice I found herds - let my subjects rejoice at it I thought I seized herds of horses from precipitous country - let the Forty Companions rejoice in that I thought When those others have assembled their heroes I shall cut off their heads like sheeps’ shall spill their blood like water I shall make Kokco’s corselet my corselet shall make his steed my work-horse I shall seize by their gleaming wrists his maidens with their crane- feathers and make them my booty I shall give them to my Companion Almambet as his share Kokco has many dappled horses - I would herd them together and lift them would hitch to my saddle-strap the silk halters for his foals and when he came in hot pursuit I would waylay him and run him through Astride his Kuroncu Kokco came in hot pursuit and shouted to Manas Let us camp on a level neck of land between rivers with the six myriad horses you have lifted and make equal division Let us camp on level ground at the confluence with the seven myriad horses you drove and divide them equally There are ninety dark-bay pacers - take them at your barrier as well There are sixty dappled pacers - take them for your white-bearded Father too There are seventy dappled pacers - do take them as your Maternal Nephew’s Pick take them at your barrier too Manas then said this to Kokco Let one of us two not survive for I do not agree with you at all I will not camp on that neck of land will not make equal division I shall give you nothing If your strength avails take (all) and be content If your strength fails whine away like a stinking cur The man who dies over herds is a cur Manas Let us both die over herds I will hand you my fire-spurting slow-wick handgun that loads twelve charges - Pour in ball with cupped hands Pour in powder by platefuls I shall expose my white chest for you to a narrow hand’s breadth thus Then you try your best shot with the handgun If you kill me with your shot drive off all my herds But if you fail to kill me I shall not submit to your violence To him Manas made answer I do not fear you one whit Whether it be exchanging thrusts or shots or blows I shall tangle with you to the death shall exchange shots with the handgun give and take blows with swords When you shoot I shall have no fear when you strike I shall not be afraid My strong waist has been bound by the Sash the Corselet I have donned is my tunic Thus Manas mounted Ak-kula donned Ak-kubo and so resolutely rode out Aydar-khan’s son Er Kokoo bestraddled his steed Kuroycu and put on his vivid tunic Er Kokco took the field on one side and Manas on the other The two came face to face uttered no word between them They drew close to one another - Lovely is the Almali-too - and seized each other by the collar dragged each other up then dragged each other down Then Kokco implored him Let go of my collar you have dragged it up and then down You have raided my herds and cut down my Forty Companions Thinking Let your former ways prevail let your anger subside - With you quarreling with your in-laws tussling with your wives - did I ever turn my lash on you or utter a hard word Let go of my collar After all you are the illustrious Manas and I am the illustrious Kokco Turning cur and fighting one another turning slave and tearing at one another - we don't want to get a bad name do we The time has come for one of us two to die because of cattle When I said Stop Stop you did not comply you did not heed my words He handed Manas the fire-spurting slow-wick handgun that loads twelve charges put in powder by platefuls poured in ball by handfuls then Manas fired with aloud report Kokco’s steed Kuroncu lifted this Kokco up and turned into blue smoke Kokco was not there the handgun had not struck this Kokco And now Kokco stands beside him roaring with laughter Hand me the fire- spurting handgun I shall put in powder by platefuls pour in ball by handfuls Become a branch of spirea Manas Be so kind as to stand still Manas I wish to bang at you in turn With your buttons buttoned-up tight your laces firmly laced when the mortal bullet reaches you - Ak-kubo halt it May it not be open anywhere May the ball not take the wrong path Manas Manas do not die Kokco fired with a loud report The discharge reached Manas’s heart This Ak-kula he was riding lifted him up and fled Kokco called after him You are an Only Son Manas I too am my Father’s Only Son Both you and J are Only Ones Of us Two one will remain This eye of mine looked along the sights - why did you take to flight Manas This hand of mine engaged the touch-hole - why did you stay rooted to the spot Manas I have a fine china cup and fine pounded drugs For bringing the dead back to life rekindling a fire that has been quenched I have my pills wrapped in white cotton have my drugs wrapped in white cotton I shall work on it from the inside and rub in drugs from the outside I shall restore you completely Else you will lie dead to no purpose on the path That Manas was wounded Calling on Allah he mounted and set out on a far journey He was with God the Creator his Friend and with the White Padashah From saying God God I used to think myself God but is not God different from all other This Manas was indeed not God but he took the name of God on his lips From saying Hoya Hoya I used to think myself God O God o my Hoja give me patience for this transient life Stallion-jawed black- tongued’ Ajibay who roars like the Tiger say what shall I do Almambet who falls on his prey like the Feline say what shall I do Kaman Jaypur you two lads who never lose tracks of the karsak that moves panting( ) in the dark Tursun Taylak you two lads who do not miss the fox-tracks by night And you two youngsters Elim and Seit My Calbay son of Kuldur and Balbay riding beside him My Sirgak and Kok Serek And among my sixty-six venal friends Kara-toko my Soul Friend on Resurrection Day - Stars-of-the-Sky Warriors Otters-of-the-Water Warriors Most junior of the Forty Companions Taz-baymat brew tea in the kettle For twenty days and twenty nights I have been in the Underworld unable to find my Forty on this path Now that I am gone to the Beyond how shall I abide its torment Riding right through the Underworld and reaching the land of people - were I to die from that would it not be fitting O my God o my Hoja give me patience for this transient life Kokco seized his bridle Halt Do halt Halt now Manas Do stop Hold Hold there Manas ' With Kokco lifting Manas Manas lifting Kokco they held each other and flew below the sun with its heavenly clouds and above the jointed grasses They then came down to earth Gripping Manas’s bridle Kokco went on pulling Ak-kula’s mouth was torn Manas saw it as he bent down he gripped his sword in its sheath and drew it and hacked at Kokco who was still holding the bridle Kokco alighted from his horse and ran away but the blow severed Kuroncu whom he had been riding at the waist Were I to strike and kill you too it would be a sin in the eyes of Allah Let the four legs be food for you for four days Roast the four legs and eat them up Kokco Your steed Kuroncu is dead go destitute Four leg-hides in four days will make rawhide boots for your legs The Forty Companions chase a herd He that roars like the Tiger Ajibay chases the herd he that resembles the high green spine of Boz-adir like God above Almambet drives the herd - he that is like the grey-maned He-wolf a high yellow pasture Almambet goes driving them You will go driving the herds and come to my home My Father white- bearded Jakip-bay will come out and meet you as will my sister Kardigac My Mother the old lady Bagdi-doolot will come out and waylay you asking Where is mountainous Manas I shall turn off from this path shall chop the root from the willow -

I shall go to them and seize them Between steep banks washed by the river the child of an old man and woman the last of nine sons Er Tostuk son of Eleman-bay Tostuk whom God’s own lips called Son - him I made submit to me When Almambet demanded Tekeci’s Kok-ala with a back like a hollow-in-the-hills and Kokco would not give it him when he asked for that steed Kok-ala seized with such glory from Tekeci together with sixty-nine horses a black-tailed camel and a comely young slave-woman with a child and Kokco denied him Almambet was offended That Kokco made a boast I shall not give him my Kok-ala I took Tekeci’s lover for my sport If one ever does the right thing I did so when I took her I took his lover to frolic with - such was my abduction of a woman Almambet stood up and shouted You are singing your own praises and demeaning Tekeci - how are you harming me I thought I gave a woman away in marriage - I shall not address myself to that woman There are [other] women on the way maidens on the mountain-pass I shall get on my horse and ride away to Er Jamgirci Sultan of the Nogoy I shall become his companion there will be some widow there and I shall come to a fair arrangement with her Though I sit together with you in the same place you do not give me your Kok-ala Has Kok-ala eaten his fill Am I not worth a horse Do you think I will go on foot and from going on foot will die How can you begrudge me a horse Kok-ala’s outside is hair his inside filth If he dies clean he is a cauldron of meat if polluted carrion for dogs and birds I was not thought worthy of Kok-ala I lost my affection for Kokco I swear I shall go to Manas and going become his companion I shall submit to Manas’s wisdom acquiesce in his true sayings when mounting and riding out on journeys I Manas have ridden out for Almambet’s sake I have seized Er Kokco’s horses Fighting with Kokco as turning slave we tore at one another I killed his brown steed I shall destroy the Chinese inflict torment on the Kizil-bas people make those of Ind weep grind the Tajiks to powder For the White Padishah’s people the Russians with hairy mouths a feast has been set for their eating - on the heads of each there are flowing locks I shall never brush up against the White Padishah’s people - my waist was wound round with a sash-of-honour I became a peaceful fellow-subject with the White Padishah’s people My Tiger-like Padishah where can your knout not strike When you ride out no grass grows on your tracks no enemy goes on fighting the White Padishah’s people In the presence of the White Padishah Manas uttered his plea Then the White Padishah spoke Do what has never been done to all the other heroes (But) don’t knock down all the skittles Manas don’t brush up against the White Padishah’s people ever If throwing your good sense to the winds you do affront them let me not see your anger If you give horses to those who have none cloaks to them that lack them food to those without it - where there's a chest there'll be caughing - God will raise you up He will pamper you with lordly titbits will let you live to a hundred will give you the head of the hearth will give you a full long life - live and adorn this world Live heeding these words of mine For if you forget them you will die young my Manas He Who created Both Worlds God the Creator has made him called the White Padishah great God has made the Padishah mighty If I am angered I shall inspire dread - I shall torment the Chinese Er Manas huge as the Ala-too make common cause with the Padishah I have spread my crescent-moon brows I the White Padishah the Ruler have given the Two Leathers and Bridle into Manas’s own hand When Manas came home his father Jakip-bay came out and met him My Manas huge as the Ala-too since the Forty Companions came home you have not been seen inside three months - where have you been my dear Son Nobly born Er Manas stood before him and said My Father Khan Jakip-bay when I had rounded up and seized those herds of Kokco’s had thrust down the pursuit which followed them had taken all their gold had destroyed the Chinese cut down Joloy on the path made Jamgirci plead for his life given chase to Agis and Kojos and to both Ayu-kem and Boo-bek bound Egis and Segis followed Er Kok-koyon and Bay-mamat and yoked them - I ran their light grey steeds into condition made all the Heroes subserve my command made a Patchwork of Gold' went to the White Padishah and asked his counsel Let your steed Ak-kula eat his fill said he Let none be greater than I or you If any turn their lash on you while the White Padishah is there cut off their heads like sheeps’ spill their blood like water Manas you have inspired dread in the peoples all around Manas never brush up against the White Padishah’s people - did you hear o my Manas For if you do my [outraged] Blessing will punish Manas | shall have no fear of heroes of any sort but I shall not go raiding as hitherto I seized Kayip’s daughter Kara-borukk from the steppe took Sooruk’s daughter Akilay from the fort as booty - I never married a girl in the customary way never knew a bride's embraces My Khan-Father Jakip-khan bit your thoroughbred Mount and seek out a bride I want to marry a fine woman wish to know a bride’s embraces Jakip-bay you mounted and rode out But they say Jakip rides and finds no young woman He rides on and on in search of her He came up with a scabby shepherd straining his voice with shouting tending a great flock on foot Halt o Jakip-bay bawled the scabby shepherding man Why do you ride in the gloom making your cap of black sable snowy how can you so scorn your life Why do you ride by night getting your cap of fox-fur so wet You have a son Warrior Manas While this Manas is there have you gone without a mount Have you come to find a horse While this Manas is there have you lacked a cloak Have you come to find one While Warrior Manas is there have you gone in want of food Have you come in search of some Tramping on foot you are a muddlehead Where have you seen me young man I have never seen you before Jakip-bay I have always tended the sheep from the pen yet have heard your fame from afar I knew you from your bearing knew you from your stately person While Manas is there I have never gone without a mount I have not come to find a horse I have never gone in want of food I have not come in search of any I have never lacked a cloak I have not come to find one This son of mine Warrior Manas received a name from the Whitebeard Manas went into the presence of the White Padishah and received his Blessing I was filled by his Blessing and ceased from all my raiding I have not yet revelled in pleasures have not yet taken a lovely wife as bridegroom night-visiting or experienced every delight He bitted Ak-kula bade me seek a maiden Seeking Salt for my eating seeking a maiden for Manas’s marrying I have made my black sable cap snowy got my cap of fox-fur wet Unable to find a maiden anywhere in these lands why have J been tormenting my soul The shepherd took these words of his to heart and answered Jakip-bay O Father Jakip-bay I shall take and slaughter my yearling ewe my one and only light grey yearling ewe my pittance as a hireling I shall roast it and give it you Then give me your Auspicious Blessing I shall tell you the girl’s family background Temir-khan’s daughter Kanikey is a maiden who is a good match for Manas - fanning herself like a peregrine of the reeds light as a cap-crest of copper she will shake her gold ear-pendants and surely please her father-in-law Jakip-khan she will make a good daughter-in-law she will shake her silver ear-rings and surely please her mother-in-law the Lady Bagdi-doolot she will make a good daughter-in-law [Like] a quiver girt round one’s waist there is among Temir-khan’s people a man accustomed to speak for him one who draws flowing water who when Temir-khan magnanimously gives spoils it so that he gives nothing - Mendi-bay of the grey-flecked beard He is a fellow born for trouble When Temir-khan and Jakip-khan are related by marriage and Manas has embraced her Mendi will throw you all into confusion Where you ride he will allow only grass to grow He will make all three of you enemies Manas against Temir-khan his own father Jakip-khan and his father-in-law Temir-khan Beware of this situation Jakip gave him his Auspicious Blessing and rode off to Temir-khan Mendi-bay of the grey-flecked beard glimpsed Jakip mounted his horse and trotted up to his side And having trotted up to Jakip-khan he addressed him Wearying your (crescent-)moon-jewelled horse winding his legs about with gold passing among the peoples all around from where do you come ranging where will you go ranging Your lower lip is blistered your ruddy face has paled Do you not wander summer-long wasting away after defeat in battle or starving in winter as one whose cattle are famished Have you come seeking aid after being stripped of your herds I have not wasted away at all summer-long after defeat in battle nor do I wander in winter starving as one whose cattle are famished Nor do I come seeking aid on being stripped of my herds I have a son Warrior Manas who seized Kay1p’s daughter Kara-boruk from the steppe and took Sooruk’s daughter Akilay from the fort as booty but who has never married a girl in the customary way never known a bride’s embraces So | bitted my (crescent-)moon-jewelled horse and sought a lovely bride for Manas - I ranged among the Chinese people whose muttering tongue no man fathoms but among them failed to find a maiden; I ranged among the Sart who helve their mattocks on willow laud a grey ass as a race-horse with maize-bread in their bosoms and pitchforks and mattocks on their shoulders - but among them I found no beauty for my Son Warrior Manas; I ranged among the Kalmak people who come out on to Jalpak-too to summer-pasture cut off a leg of pork and tie it to their saddle-strap and wear round skull-caps and caps with tassels but among them I found no beauty for my Son Warrior Manas I ranged among the Galcha people but there found no beauty among the Kizil-bas and found none At river-sources there are their yurts and each yurt is headed by a biy - I ranged among the Kirghiz people but there found no beauty I ranged among the people of Ind and found none the Tajik and none there I chased round the Land of Heroes and found no beauty among them I picked and chose among the Kazakh people found no beauty With God there as his friend with the White Padishah there he received a name from the Whitebeard received a Blessing from the Padishah - and the steed Ak-kula ate his fill After he had received the White Padishah’s Blessing no man gainsaid Manas There is a khan called Temir-khan and there is Salt for one’s food there is a maiden named Kanikey and if she dons a corselet they say she will be of a height and breadth with him that maiden named Kanikey will be a match for this Manas of mine so they say I have come here as matchmaker for Kanikey’s hand Mendi-bay of the grey-flecked beard wheeled his mount trotted off to Temir-khan’s yurt and alighted He then said to Temir-khan Don’t be angry Temir-khan - On the outskirts of your aul to the summit of the White Hill of Counsel white-bearded Jakip-khan has trotted on his horse but has driven no herds along has loaded no treasure on has set no slaves to work I have mounted my horse and put it to the trot I have come as matchmaker for Kanikey’s hand Will there ever be such infamy Will there ever be such outrage Turn the great river at its source - Order your slaves to beat this match-maker come so empty-handed Temir-khan then answered Coming as it does from a slave born to make trouble Mendi-bay of the grey-flecked beard I shall not join in your trouble-making Comrades of the Right Companions on the Left of the Door if this is really Jakip-khan he has a son Warrior Manas His cap is set on his head - Should he think I shall destroy the many great heroes all around he has the power Such is his son Warrior Manas Comrades of the Right Companions of the Left lift him from his horse Not letting his foot touch the ground lift him from his horse Set a soft couch Prepare a feast of weaned lamb regale him with a goulash of it Have tasty kumys shaken from milk of a young mare Have a porcelain cup a cup-on-chain enfolded and present it to him See that his thirst is well quenched and set him a soft couch Cover him warm with the coverlet Lull him quietly to sleep When dawn darts its rays and the star has set in the sky just as the sun is peeping after waking him I want to question the hero Bidding him mount his horse | wish to ascend the Mound of Heroes If he speaks friendly affable words I shall give him a friendly answer If he speaks unfriendly hard words I shall give an unfriendly answer They did as he had said Jakip rose at dawn They set a metal basin for him and he washed his face and hands When they had well quenched his thirst he went to the solitary place Temir-khan went to Jakip-khan and asked for a word with him Jakip-khan huge as the Ala-too why do you journey as though you had lost your way Mendi-bay of the grey-flecked beard is a fellow born to make trouble Saying Don’t trot into the bog he thwarts my lordly munificence by holding back my gifts making great trouble with his words Yet I have not joined in his trouble-making but have come to seek counsel of you Thereupon Jakip-khan answered If you ask the ways I have come if you will hear what I have to say -I have ranged among all the peoples of black-headed fork-legged Man Yet I have found no beauty for my Son Manas whatsoever But they say there is one whose shape is engaging with her gold ear-pendants jingling her created form such as would please me Jakip as father-in-law and would make me a good daughter-in-law - your daughter Kanikey A herald does not risk death a matchmaker does not court disgrace I have come to Kanikey I have come as matchmaker Will you taste this Salt of yours Will you give your daughter to my Manas Temir-khan stood and addressed him Do not be offended Jakip-khan - Is it not rumoured that this son of yours Manas tussles with his in-laws wrangles with his friends tangles with brothers and sisters Is it not rumoured that this son of yours Manas is much given to raiding They say he knots Ak-kula’s tail and drives off herds all around incessantly attacks great heroes exchanges thrusts with warriors makes Ak-kula smart against the hail of arrows chest-high as he comes ever-lazily along - what with seizing each other’s dazzling corselets by the gold collar and ripping them away in the melee - will he not die at the hands of one of the heroes My one and only daughter Kamikey has seen the sun only through the cupola has drunk water only through a tube ridden only choice grey amblers imbibed rare honeyed arak never taken the air with her cloak unbuttoned never known the cool caressing breezes or gone out of doors at night or joined in nocturnal feasting - So will not my one and only daughter Kamkey end up in mourning Let him cease from his raiding - Then I shall give my daughter Let him have done with shooting hacking and thrusting - Then I shall give my daughter If he does not have done with shooting hacking and thrusting I shall certainly not give my daughter Huge as the Ala-too Jakip was all ruffled like a herdsman’s tent he flew into a rage Temir-khan o Temir-khan I swear I shall go to my Manas that gnawed dried-out turds in the hollows and tell him this news Trot into the bog Temir-khan Manas will take his red pennant will come out on to the ridge and with cries of Manas wield his lance - then if you do not give him Kanikey when he asks for her he will seize her by her gleaming wrists and thrust her on to his horse’s rump and make her booty of war - then what will your strength avail you Molten curb on a horse with blaze - When he chopped the root from the willow when he went to the White Padishah intending to receive his Blessing the White Padishah spread his crescent-moon brows my White Padishah gave him all nations save Russians all save the White Padishah’s people In summer it 1s dazzling bright -- Where is your justification for not giving me your daughter Then Temir-khan spoke I say it in joke Jakip-bay I say it in fun Jakip-bay It is a night unlit by the moon a day for sifting wife and daughter then deciding I shall consult with my spouse I shall consult with my daughter I shall consult with my seniors Then I shall return Stay here Jakip-khan That Mendi-bay of the grey-flecked beard I mentioned is a fellow born to make trouble When his’ Padishah bestows his gold nuggets as large as horses’ heads as is his wont his silver ingots as big as sheeps’ heads damn me if that fellow does not always cross me by perversely crying Stop I shall take full counsel Stay here Jakip-khan Turning back he urged on his horse made his chiefs that display the standard his by and his khans of the drooping paunches all gallop their horses and assembled them in his pavilion Jakip-bay huge as the Ala-too who arrived here last evening says to me Trot into the bog Give your daughter Kanikey to my Only Son Manas What shall we do Princes Mendi-bay of the grey-flecked beard was a fellow born to make trouble He jumped up No herds have been driven along no treasure has been loaded on and brought here - are you going out of your mind when you say I shall give my daughter to one-horse Jakip I shall turn the great river at its source I shall build stout mud forts in a row I myself shall be look-out I shall make the mouths of thoroughbreds gape I shall thrust Manas the Only One through I shall make his steed a work-horse Have no fear have no fear Temir-khan’ When Mendi-bay had uttered these words Temir’s khans of the drooping paunches his chiefs that display the standard his biy addressed Mendi-bay You were not satisfied with Temir-khan’s generosity you did not cease from your trouble-making You have to be one with a grey-flecked beard - Let us be droop-paunch Khans let us be chiefs that display the standard Making peoples other than the White Padishah’s as straw and wafting them away making them as reeds and flattening them Manas will seize these maidens who wear the Crane-feather seize as booty these young wives that wear the White Kerchief He will destroy all our young braves who act the Boar \* our young braves that play the warrior Summon Jakip-khan and without letting his feet touch the ground quickly lift him up Have him mount a khan’s throne and set a soft couch for him Spread brocade and balkhi before him Wrap his legs round with costly buulum and buta Unroll a saddle-cloth of brocade and balkhi for his horse Add honey to arak pour it into a cup of gold and present it to him Lay a table-cloth and set washbasin Go before him and treat him to apricots and raisins Have him dona Nine of tunics adorned with gold Saying Jakip-bay has come as matchmaker for Temir-khan’s daughter let the people all around acclaim it Saying Fill ten hollows tell them to come driving horses Saying Fill forty hollows tell them to come driving sheep Saying Fill a hundred hollows tell them to come driving cows Saying Fill four hollows tell them to come driving camels Won’t you add some extra cattle - If he finds them will he not drive them If he does not find them won’t he go away He did as they had said he added extra cattle he agreed with that Jakip-bay returned to Manas and reaching him said Have done with your raiding says Temir-khan For if you do not I shall not give you my daughter says he Inform your Forty Companions inform Almambet who roars like the Tiger inform Ayjibay who attacks by stealth like the Feline Like the high green slopes of rounded Mt Boz-adir like God in heaven above Manas you stand here Go yourself to the White Padishah the Ruler stand in awe before him and do his bidding Manas summoned his Companions Almambet drive up a hundred horses Ajibay drive up a hundred too My Forty Companions who grew up with me all Forty together as one lord drive up forty hundred horses Will not ten hollows be filled Will not forty hollows be filled - And a hundred - And four He sent the news to them all Manas was first to arrive at Jakip-bay’s yurt Arriving he dismounted By which path shall we go Some speak friendly others unfriendly if they behave friendly we shall be friendly; if they behave unfriendly we shall be unfriendly -

Temir-khan’s daughter Kanikey saw a dream as she lay sleeping With shrill cries the poor wretch was on her feet and speaking she stood fighting for breath and said My Father and Mother since it is not two things is it one [i e certain] As I lay in the night I saw a dream This dream is a quaking ( - gulping ) dream a dream that made my heart heave - It was a moonless night and the moon was born from the hill-tops it was a sunless day and the sun was born from the hill-tops - from that pure desire sought shelter A fine Poplar a flourishing Poplar rose from the Hearth One of its Branches curved round the Eye of the Moon another Branch curved round the Eye of the Sun And when the Sun’s heat began to scorch she sought the Shade - tranquilly smiling Kanikey sought the Shade A third Branch curved round the Eye of Heaven and Jakip-khan huge as the Ala-too sought its Shade A fourth Branch curved round the Eye of the Earth and when the Earth grew cold Mistress Bagdi-doolot went to warm herself beneath it Has not my Padishah come to life come to life again Then Jakip-khan speaks Send the news to the Forty Companions my Child Your Manas huge as the Ala-too is coming alive again Your Manas like the running waters is coming a-tossing Your Manas like the Poplar 1s coming a-quivering Your Manas like the Sea is lapping his waves May your dream be no dream may it come true my Child Then Kanikey spoke Ak-kula has vanished Ak-Sumkar and Ak-taygan too What does this mean Saddle Ak-boréuk and mount Have a look along that herd Ak-kula has vanished Ak-Sumkar has gone from her stand Ak-taygan from her What does this mean Come and see Manas’s domed Tomb Jakip-khan huge as the Ala-too mounted Ak-boréuk and when he goes to that herd Manas’s Ak-kula is no longer there nor his Ak-Sumkar nor his Ak-taygan Jakip-khan huge as the Ala-too returned to his yurt and [addressed] Mistress Bagdi-doolot If Manas-bay was not dead my Manas is now no more I will say he has died The Forty Companions have left us Ak-kula whom Manas loved as his own self is not with the herd Ak-Sumkar darling of the dead Manas - whom he cherished as though she were his child - is not on her stand Ak- taygan' whom he loved as though she were his younger brother is not in her house After the lord Manas died they brought solace to my heart Ak-kula I am parted from you - what Remedy is there for me I am parted from Ak-Sumkar whom he cherished as though she were his child - what Remedy avails me Ak-taygan whom he loved as his younger brother I am parted from you - what Remedy avails me My Running Stream showing white athwart the bluff my Twin Lamps that I hold in my hands (My people have not decamped from his people )' When I light them in the night my Pupils always watching my Lamps that I hold are not extinguished That Manas is no more Now that Manas has passed beyond the Forty Companions have departed from me - what Remedy is there In nights unlit by the moon in days when I have grown old Iam of an age that has lost its strength My life has reached the age of eighty Atatime when one should be serene I have lost my Wings I have been parted from Khan Manas the Forty Companions have departed from me Ak-kula loved as Manas himself what shall I do regarding you Now that Manas has passed beyond my unbending oaken Staff you have bent at the strongest part On the aged Jakip-khan you have piled a hundred panniers bottoms up Alas Ak-taygan what shall I do regarding you My unyielding birchen Staff you have bent at the very middle On my Lady now grown very old you have tipped as good as a hundred panniers From a dapple-bay mare no [pure] bay foal for riding can be born - From a Jakip who has reached ninety no warrior such as Mans can now be born Aged Jakip-khan mount Ak-bortuk do Go to the Forty Companions Tell how matters stand with Ak-Sumkar how they stand with Ak-kula how they stand with Ak-taygan Has God befriended Manas Is Manas in the thoughts of the Forty Companions Is Manasin their hearts Jakip-bay went out and mounted He went to him that roars like the Tiger to Almambet to stallion-jawed soft-spoken Ajibay Ak-kula is not with the herd - where shall we seek him Ak-Sumkar is not on the stand nor Ak-taygan in the collar - where shall we find them What Remedy is there now what Way-out can there be Having lost my Wings being parted from Khan Manas now that | have grown old whenever I have looked at Ak-kula cherished like Manas himself my eyes were contented - Bring all Three to light wherever they are I have known days of dazzling sunshine have feasted by bright moonlight I have gone my ways stepping out proudly - It is with your help that I have donned my cloak If the Three have left This World I shall strike my dagger into my heart and follow behind Manas shall topple from the Tomb to my death and join Manas Ajibay and Almambet will not scour( ) the world one like the other they pay no heed Jakip-khan turned back lamenting and came to Mistress Bagdi-doolot O Mistress what shall we do I did the round of the Forty Companions they do not respect his precepts and will not give a Feast for his Spirit They have forgotten him entirely Then the Mistress replied Jakip-khan huge as the Ala-too did you go to Serek and Sirgak to Kara-toko his soul-friend or Bakay -Did you go and tell the news I did not tell them the news Go to those three and tell them Fetch the wretched shallow-counselling Serek and Sirgak - all three including Bakay Salute them - Let us show our devotion let us go to Manas’s Grave Jakip-khan galloped back He got Serek and Sirgak to mount Among Manas’s sixty-six venal friends there is his soul-friend for the Afterlife Kara-toko and him he asked to mount He went to Bakay - Bakay the Sart Bay's son who boasts when drinking mead and rides when drunk - and made him mount They made a Four together and reined in at Mistress Bagdi-doolov's yurt Then Bakay the Sart son of Bay led the way to Manas’s Tomb Bakay you who boast when drinking mead and ride when drunk you have mounted your horse and come Serek and that Sirgak you two have mounted and come The horse named Kok-bortuk is trotting along - when will Manas’s soul-friend Kara-toko come The tears in the eyes of Bakay son of Bay form a lake as he stands there breaking down and sobbing He is bitter over Manas’s dying Among his sixty-six venal friends there is his soul-friend for the Afterlife Kara-toko -he has failed to appear even now his mount has made no pace If Manas huge as the Ala-too offered gold did Kara-toko accept it from him Have his soul-friend Kara-toko’s feelings for Manas cooled now Elim Seyit you two lads Serek and Sirgak when Kara-toko comes I shall give some advice befitting my age The most junior of the Forty Companions Taz-baymat who when Manas 1s thirsty alights and brews tea - Let us dole out gold like copper Let us leave this place and go and see Manas’s Tomb Drop down exhausted( ) where the stream broadens out - where Manas used to gallop his horse in sport with the Forty Companions - lie down there in the shade On the maidan stands a Poplar - Let us go there Let us dismount at the foot of the tree pitch the White Pavilion with its sixty cords straight up to the sky set the Prince on his throne and raise up Jakip huge as the Ala-too as Khan aged though he be Let us slaughter a pale-grey mare and sacrifice her to Manas’s (Ancestor-)spirit(s) Let us recite the Qur’an with its Kulkuldabat and the Last Prayer of the day Let us recite the verses from the Throne-chapter the Iman too and prayers galore Is all well with Ak-kula with Ak-taygan and Ak-Sumkar They did as Bakay had said they now moved over and took their station Thinking He ordered Serek to mount’ Serek made his way to the head of Manas’s Tomb beside the dome But Manas’s dome had vanished - Instead of the domed Tomb there stood a Pavilion more splendid than any mausoleum They (the Angels ) had made a horse resembling Ak-kula and a golden crib - they had strewn raisins over his barley - and there stands Ak-kula at the crib Ak-sumkar is perched on her stand Ak-taygan stands in her collar Serek steps up and with a jerk reveals the seat of honour - Manas-khan is lying there he has thrust down the bedding to his waist and such as no glory accorded to the moon or beauty to the sun after Manas has draped her in balkhi and brocade and she has pinned coral over pearls and lapped herself in velvet there sits a lovely girl supporting Manas’s head The Four looked at him one and all and their hearts were near to bursting Ah God oh my Hoja If the keen sword had a sheath if it is true that Ak-kula and Ak-Sumkar and Manas have returned to life I shall take a Nine of sheep a Nine of cows a Nine of camels and a Nine of horses For the Forty Companions from first to last I shall put up a Nine and say Grant my prayer Galloping our horses and making a feast with Bakay son of Bay as leader all around let him fulfil each desire Let ancient Bakay-khan sit as your Companion-of-Honour at Manas’s side God has spread his crescent-moon brows He has granted ancient Bakay’s wish When he rode out his path was made even Manas who had died has come to life again and been reunited with Bakay Let Bakay spread his hands for Manas to receive the Blessing If he command it let him taste food Er Manas is risen up and come to life again May he live to be a thousand And now Serek cries Your Father has come Manas stand up The Lady Bagdi-doolot your Mother has come Manas stand up The Forty Companions have come Manas stand up He who boasts when drinking mead and rides when he is drunk who riding a thoroughbred tires him out who has grown old in company with Jakip-khan Manas Bakay son of Bay has come so Manas stand up Almambet has come Manas stand up Elim and Seyit the two lads have come Manas now stand up Kaman and Joypur the two lads have come Manas stand up Star-warriors of the Sky Manas Otter-warriors of the Water Manas they too have come stand up Manas Kiildiir’s son your Calbay Manas accompanied by your Bal-day Manas they too have come stand up Manas Make the blood of the Chinese people flow Manas Muster your Forty Companions Manas Manas now spoke I think little of the enemy I do not know what I was When one says My Father what does it mean Or My Mother or The Forty Companions what does it mean J am not dead I am not alive I have become something else And now Serek spoke You did not recognize your Father Manas did not recognize your Mother or the Forty Companions Manas Do you remember Bakay Manas Do you remember your soul-friend for the After-life Kara-toko among your sixty-six venal friends Kara-toko the soul-friend replied Manas I helved the Red Standard- with-white-streamers on the gleaming spear I led the Forty Companions riding my thoroughbred I gained a name I went to the White Padishah himself and received his Blessing Did I not die and am alive again Fetch my Father Jakip-khan Fetch my Mother the Lady Bagdi-doolot Fetch the Forty Companions one and all Blow the trumpets and war-fifes Announce Manas’s return to life now to the people Rush the news to Mistress Bagdi-doolot and claim your Reward Bring my Mother with all speed They did according to his words They blew trumpets and war-fifes Manas has come alive again they said announcing it to the teeming people They went to his Mother The good Manas your darling has mounted Ak-kula has put on Ak-kubo has cast off his Ak-sumkar - Manas has come alive again The Mistress Bagdi-doolot Let us mount and go She put her white kerchief round her head mounted and set out for her goal Serek told Manas the news They did not tell the Lady Bagdi-doolot to enter the six-winged White Pavilion nor his widowed Kanikey to go to Manas’s side they opened the door for Manas and he rose from the seat of honour as she came with outstretched hands to welcome him On the evening of the day before the Lady Bagdi-doolot had been in his thoughts After you had died my Darling your Mother Mistress Bagdi-doolot lost her sight to the point of total blindness My handsome Darling have you not undergone a change Over the Margin - my Darling have you crossed over the Margin I shall tie up what remains unscattered of my hair I shall wash my whole body shall cleanse myself utterly She tied up what remained unscattered of her hair washed her whole noble person and made it clean She then made for Manas she went in and stood over mighty Manas Then the Mistress Bagdi-doolot became a mother again a strong tremor went over her hard dry breasts and Manas sucked the milk He seated the Mistress Bagdi-doolot on the throne They had extinguished the fire that had been kindled (but now) Jakip elevated Manas as Khan he went and settled him in the aul He ordered them to take a Nine of camels and a Nine of horned cattle while the Forty Companions took forty Nines and had them all slaughtered telling the lean and hungry to eat their fill Them that had grown old Jakip and Bakay Manas elevated as Princes and set them on princely thrones After Manas had passed away the khan’s daughter Kanikey she whose White Bone had turned to ash who of free estate had become a slave had fended for them all three her Father-in-law Jakip-khan her Mother-in-law the Mistress Bagdi-doolot and Manas's sister Kardigac begging fat from some tea from others and loaves of bread from yet others and now Manas had learned that she had kept them alive and his heart was well content with her He set Lady Bagdi-doolot close beside him He had his herds summer on flieless mountains had young foals tethered in swarms made mountains of meat made lakes of soup bade his lean and hungry ones eat their fill From Jakip-khan he took fame from Bakay he received the Blessing Jakip-khan settled on one river Bakay on another Manas on another and so with Ajibay Kara-toko Almambet Serek and Sirgak He surveyed all Mankind he ruled over all except the Ak-padishah’s peoples - Manas's Ak-kula ate his fill Manas did not clash with the White Padishah’s people at all He slept in bliss without contention he slept tranquilly When people could not agree the White Padishah advised him And when he gave advice what did they say Lookto Manas he sald My Padishah you decide said the other If I am to decide’ replied the Padishah do not get set in your anger do not come to blows with the many peoples Manas had swallowed the food handed down to him he held sway over all the peoples After receiving the Padishah’s Blessing Manas prospered his enemies wandered away he attained bliss and the goal of his desires
