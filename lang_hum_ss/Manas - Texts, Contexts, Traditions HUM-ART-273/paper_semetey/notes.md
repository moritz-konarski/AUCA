#### Notes

- _SMB_
- Kirghiz
- not published 
- 1899
- two _Semetey_ poems
- monument of Kirghiz literature
- one of the oldest concerns of native Kirghiz (p. 195)
- first mix of oral bards and mullas doing stuff for turkic-speaking
  consumption
- MBU wasn't the original author and there were two of them
- MBU transcribed the text instead of transcribing it
- he probably wasn't an accomplished oral poet
- the two poems show differences in orthography, epithets and the like -> two
  different bards/poets
- a bard would not have let the differences in the text slide
- the fact that he did marks him as a literati or connoisseur
- the handwriting does confirm that MBU copied both of them though
- here we have the problem that it is completely uncertain how many
  copies/iterations the texts MBU copied went through before he did
- thus it is a work of literature, not directly oral epic poetry, even though
  it embodies it
- the structure of the text fits more into the twilight age than the old age
- shows a bridging of when the story was more than a short part of the epics
  but not yet the fully fleshed-out version of later bards
- is pretty similar to the last part of I,6), but has flashbacks and all that
  as well
- the flashbacks that put _Manas_ material into _Semetey_ were a twilight-age
  invention
- I,6) and _SMB(1)_ are largely similar in content, but not in form
- __differences__: Kanikey condones and blesses _Semetey_ and Manas' _arbak_
  settles upon _Semetey_ when he performs rituals at Manas' tomb
- the art stayed the same in the twilight era -- the ethos changed
- here there is no trouble with with his mother, might be spared some troubles
  through Manas's _arbak_, gets more direct help from Bakay and 
- he postulates that Bakay could be removed from the story as Kanikey now
  blesses his journey -- Bakay is just too good of a character to just delete
- there are some fragments in there
- Kanikey is reduced to a mere mother here, Ciycir is now the one that must say
  something witty -- she says he's a hero, but unprepared and will be back soon
- new is that _Semetey_ proves his identity to Abuke and Kobos by telling them
  about Manas's exploits -- even though he just learned about them earlier
- Bakay is really haphazardly added to this poem, there are multiple elements
  that do not make sense
- the talking horse outside of something like a lament is rare and probably to
  fill a gap in the plot -- a break with earlier tradition and new era of less
  strict rules
- K and BD are not taken for the ride and remain behind -- only to appear
  magically when the final battle commences
- heroic structure was disappearing and the unpacking of the narrative led to
  some problems like the one above
- the only thing that really happens is that _Semetey_ drives out his nephews
  and recovers his patrimony
- there are almost 40 companions, which would be crazy for an oral poet, but
  written down it is not totally surprising
- here the descriptions of S's possessions, steeds on the walls take up about
  10% of the poem
- itineraries are absent from this text
-
