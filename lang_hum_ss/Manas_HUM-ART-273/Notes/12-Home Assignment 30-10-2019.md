  campaign, then she asks if S will come and save her, C tells her that this
  will not happen

- they can't find a ford, so S decides to just go for it, against Kan-coro's
  suggestion, he is willing to risk death to see AC's eyes

  prays/pleads with all kinds of figures, he needs to be dragged out of the
  water

  as he was asked

  leave
- AC again says that they have been betrothed since before birth, and she
  waited for him; dares him to take the falcon
- they feast and want to rest after the long journey, but AC tells them to
  first get to the safety of the city, then they can rest and "enjoy
  themselves"
- there is a yurt in a city where AC properly hosts S and the companions
- AC and S "lie together", S falls asleep, AC leaves, KC wants to check on
  them, notices and wakes S
- they find her in her father's chambers, S is amazed by the decorations, he
  grabs AC by hair and breast, she tells him to fuck off and tell this story to
  his wife
