# New Mass Media - In-class notes 11.09.2019

## What are mass media?

- mass -> popular, common, for the masses
- media -> something that transmits something else, transmits something,
  channel

## Khan Academy video on mass media

- video on four different types of media analysis:
- media also has a teaching function, but falls short of that often
- promotes stuff through ads
- _Functionalist Perspective_: what media actually does, how it influences
  society, entertainment; spread messages (teach norms), set framework; but
  sometimes media portrays criminals as cool -> contradiction; socialization
- _Conflict Perspective_: how the media protrays and handles conflicts (between
  social groups) in our society, amplifies or soothes them
- _Feminist Perspective_: feminist perspective on the whole shebang, how media
  handles gender roles etc., dominant figure tend to be male, women tend to be
  in second place; not always the case
- _Interactionist Perspective_: how we connect with other people through media
- mass media often reflects the dominant ideology
- gatekeepers govern what the media shows, they are often rich, white men
- tokenism instead of actual integration

## Talking about the text

- linear model: sender sends message to audience in straight line, through
  gatekeepers:
- audience receives and decodes the message
- gatekeepers are e.g. editors, governments, corporate powers...
- this model assumes that there is no distortion of the message
- message can be stopped, misunderstood...
- e.g. Euro-jargon: very specific terms that only the elite (or informed) understand,
  bad for communication with the masses, they will not understand it or
  dispise it because of the jargon
- another problem might be a language barrier that leaves part of the
  audience in the dark
- the medium is also important, some media are better suited than others
  for specific audience, e.g. specific TV programs for targeted
  advertisement
- message can be re-told by others and they will re-code and maybe change
  the message, distorting it
- filtering information by what we like or not like, what interests us, how
  much information there is in what time, just because there is too much to
  consume it all
- Sections of Communication History: Oral, Written, Printed, Electronic,
  Digital
- Group 1: Oral and Written Era
    - local information spread, hard to circulate, very elite (writing)
    - writing left someting from that time for us to analyse vs. oral tradition
    - oral communication is limited in time, distortion is very common
    - written was only for the most important messages of rich and wealthy
      people
    - drawbacks: slow, locally bound, inefficient, elite (writing/reading),
      only few copies of information, destruction is very common -> loss of
      information forever
- Group 2: Printed Era
    - print made reproduction alot easier, took away the human work for a lot
      of the steps -> mechanization -> actual mass media can emerge
    - reading became more common, literacy increased
    - drawbacks: sets information in stone, books can still be burned
    - print is still based on physical media -> limitation
- Group 3: Electronic Era
    - TV, radio, telegraph
    - easier to use, actually mass media, as its not bound to physical media
    - now replication actually can hit everyone
    - now propaganda became a lot more effective
- Group 4: Digital Era - find examples for medium, (why did this get outmatched),
  what came next, what are the drawbacks?
    - medium is the internet
    - videos, streaming, pictures, blogs, online news(papers), radio, books,
      all the traditional stuff, converged to this
    - everyone can do it, its not difficult to start producing content, very
      different from previous periods, where serious capital was needed
    - drawbacks of this convergence are an absolute flood of information,
      misinformation because there are no gatekeepers, decentralization, maybe
      democratization, less control of the internet by governments etc. could
      lead to crime, breaking the law..., there is no one telling you what is
      true and what is false, you have to see for yourself, can be swamped by
      information, there is no one holding your hand, the flood of information
      might also drown out/devalue individual contributions, tricky advertising
      and changing of our perception
    - information is out there for ever, you can never really erase something
      that was once on the internet
    - privacy is a big concern, not that it really exists anymore
