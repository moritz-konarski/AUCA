# Encryption in Digital Media

- __open data and data visualization__
- __what kind of data is available for visualization??__
- __find data on encryption__
- hark back to the CGP Grey video on encryption for some nice points
- __What is an interesting topic??__
- encryption is vital to modern digital (mass) media
- because the internet is open, data needs to be encrypted
- nobody would use email if someone could easily read what they are writing
- no online commerce/banking would be possible without proper encryption of
  transactions
- no accounts could be created if passwords and data were not protected by
  encryption
- encryption was used in earlier forms of media, like telephone calls and
  ciphers in letter etc.
- those forms of media had another level of security: the physical one
- the internet takes that away by connecting everyone to everyone else
- nobody needs to intercept the letter in transit or be in a specific area to
  record a phonecall, everyone can come to your digital door whenever they like
