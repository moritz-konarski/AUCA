# EU encryption debate

## Introduction

- encryption is an essential part of europe's open markets and societies
- terror attacks started quite a debate about encryption as it was seen as
  beneficial to terrorism and the like
- Europol and other LEA called for a counter, as they saw a threat
- member demanded a policy decision -- it reminds of the Crypto Wars
- EA would threaten cross-border networks while strong encryption would create
  a safe haven for criminals
- there is currently no solution in sight
- Europol budget is being increased, LEAs are offered training and consulting

## Background

- terror attacks in 2014, 2015, and 2016 sparked the debate
- IOCTA 2016 pointed to encryption as one of the major threats to terrorism
  investigations
- EU members demanded a policy solution
- LEAs warn about cse, corruption, cyber crime in general
- member states have very different capabilities and rules when it comes to
  encryption
- cooperation is slow

## Key Actors

- pro regulation: Germany, France, UK
- anti regulation: academics, technologists, civil society organizations
- business groups called for encryption to be encouraged
- VP for the Digital Single Market opposed weak encryption or EA
- Europol and ENISA made a deal to not mandate backdoors as those do more harm
  than good
- Europol complained about going dark 
- EU legislation might be tricky as it does not have a mandate, members would
  have to do it themselves but they have widely different budgets and tech
- Europol is encouraging member states LEAs to build their own arsenals; urges
  more cooperation in this regard
- they say that there could be a solution striking a balance between individual
  rights and the protection of citizen's security interests
