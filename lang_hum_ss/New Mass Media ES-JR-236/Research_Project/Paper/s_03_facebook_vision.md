# Privacy-Focused Vision for Social Networking

## Introduction

- Z was addressing the biggest challenges facing FB
- means taking positions concerning the future of the internet
- he'll outline visions and principles around a privacy-focused messaging and
  social networking platform
- last 15 years: helping people connect with friends in kind of a town square
- now they also want to be a living room
- privacy-focused communications will be more important in the future
- privacy gives people the freedom to be themselves and connect more naturally
- we see private messaging, ephemeral stories, small groups are the fastest
  growing area of online communications
- intimacy is often important: one-on-one or with few friends
- permanent records are less liked now
- everyone expects to be able to do stuff privately
- public sm will remain important -- there is still a lot of value there -- but
  now there is an opportunity to build a simpler, privacy focused platform
- he knows most people would not expect FB to do something like this, they do
  not currently have a good reputation for that
- but they have also shown that they can respond to demands and build private
  stories or messaging
- Z believes comms will become more private, encrypted services -- messages are
  secure and not around forever
- building shall be like WhatsApp: messaging, as secure as possible, and then
  build stuff on top of that

## Private interactions

- simple, intimate places with clear control over who can communicate and
  have security that no one can access stuff

## Encryption

- private communication should be secure -- end-to-end encryption does that and
  prevents anyone from reading them

## Reducing Permanence

- people should be themselves without worrying that stuff comes back to hurt
  them
- messages won't be around longer than necessary for delivery or how long the
  user wants

## Safety

- do all that they can to keep people safe on an encrypted service

## Interoperability

- any of their apps should be able to communicate with all others across
  networks and securely do so

## Secure data storage

- not storing data in countries with weak records of human rights (privacy,
  freedom of expression) to prevent improper access

## Recap

- over the next few years they want to build more of their services around
  these principles
- there are a lot of tradeoffs to get right, and they will do the best and
  consult experts and out in the open

## Private Interactions as a Foundation

- privacy = never any doubt about who are you communicating with
- public networks have their uses for all kinds of stuff -- more like a town
  square than a private group
- there is the opportunity to build a social network that is more like
  a private living room
- making a service _feel_ private is much more than the tech behind it -- it
  involves design that gives the user the feeling of privacy too
- Z expects Messenger and WhatsApp to become the main ways people communicate
  on the FB network
- focused on making both of these apps faster, simpler and more secure
  __including entd-to-end encryption__
- then they'll add more features that allow private communications
- this will make everything easier and more private

## Encryption and Safety

- private communications should be only seen by the intended recipients and not
  hackers, __over-reaching govs__ or even the service operators
- growing awareness of the relation between the number of actors and the
  likelihood that an error or attack would expose the data
- technology can be seen as centralizing power in the hands of some governments
  or companies; or accessing data for advertisements and the like
- __e2e encryption is an important tool in developing of privacy-focused
  networks__
- encryption is decentralizing -- it takes power away from central authorities
  that now cannot read the messages -- __that is why the built e2e into
  WhatsApp__
- encryption can help dissidents and keep them alive
- if a gov asks for data outside of legality but it's enforced, if there is no
  encryption, FB would have to expose plain text data
- all the same, there are a lot of problems to solve before e2ee can be
  implemented across all the services
    - encryption includes the privacy to do bad things
    - some of users will do horrible things with their privacy: child
      exploitation, terrorism, extortion
    - FB has the responsibility to work with LEAs to do whatever they can
    - there will be a definite tradeoff, as even today when they can see the
      messages some slip through the cracks -- encrypted this would be even
      more difficult
    - there are still many questions related to that and they will consult with
      experts, LEA and govs on ways to implement safety measures
    - we need to work together to get this right
- on balance, implementing e2ee is the right thing to do
