# Open Letter on Privacy First

## Statement 

- asking FB not to implement e2ee across its messaging services
- if they do: must ensure that there is no reduction to user safety; lawful
  access to content must be given for the protection of our citizens
- he acknowledged that there are real concerns when it comes the this plan
- there must be fighting agains cse, terrorism and extortion
- we welcome this commitment to consultation
- some govs have engaged with FB on this issue, but there have been no real
  results
- we support strong encryption, used by millions of people every day for
  important, secure services
- we also respect promises made to protect user's data
- law abiding citizens have a legitimate expectation that their privacy will be
  respected
- nevertheless, tech cos must protect users and others from their users'
  activities 
- security enhancements in the virtual world should not make us more vulnerable
  in the physical world
- there needs to be a balance between privacy and security, as in LEA access to
  data to protect the public, investigate crimes, and prevent future criminal
  activity -- if this is not done our LEAs will have trouble
- services should not be designed to preclude any access to their data as it
  stops companies from detecting and then LEAs from fighting the things they
  normally do
- FB would then offer public profiles and closed communication, unique routes
  for people to groom our children
- facebook made more than 90% of the reports to he NCMEC in 2018, some of them
  useful for the UK, and also took down 26 million pieces of terrorist content
- over 99% of these two things were found by safety systems, not users
- tear-wrenching example of a child that was sexually abused 100s of times and
  facebook found this case and some chats that showed the history of the abuse
- they estimate that much of that reporting would be gone if Facebook took the
  steps that they outlined
- NCMEC estimates that 70% of the reporting, 12 million reports, would be lost
  globally
- this would significantly increase the risk of cse and other serious harms
- Z himself stated that this tradeoff is a thing -- and they are worried that
  it is the wrong tradeoff to make -- FB would become and unsafe space,
  including for children
- LEA rely on the ability to obtain the content of communications to fight
  crime

## Calls to Action

1. embed the safety of the public in system design -- enabling acting against
  illegal content effectively with no reduction of safety, and facilitating the
  prosecution of offenders and the protection of victims
2. enable LEA to get access to content in a readable and usable format
3. engage in consultation with governments to achive these two points and
  actually take their considerations seriously
4. don't implement the systems until they are fully operational and maintain the
  safety of your users
- we are committed to working with you to protect the privacy of the users as
  well as the public
- __our experts are confident that we can do so while defending cyber security
  and supporting technological innovation__
- getting this right is important for the future of the internet
- children's safety and lEAs ability to bring justice must not be the ultimate
  cost of Facebook taking forward these proposals
