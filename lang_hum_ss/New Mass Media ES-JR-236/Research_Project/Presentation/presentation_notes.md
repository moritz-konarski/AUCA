#### Introduction

- this presentation has a different structure than my paper -- shows my
'journey'
- wanted to work on encryption
- encountered the problems and the debate about encryption
- wanted to know what the answers were, if there were any
- found the example of Facebook Messenger which is current and important
- then I went on to see what the EU would say about this -- prompted by
a letter
- __became an analytical paper on what is encryption, debate in the EU,
connection to Facebook's proposal, possible solutions to the issue__
- __Who of you uses Facebook Messenger? WhatsApp? Instagram?__

#### Basics -- wanted to do research on because of interest

- what is encryption?
- flowchart shows in the most general terms how it works
- caesar cipher is one of the simplest
- RSA is an asymmetric algorithm that is used today, here with 512 bit keys in
base64 encoding
- these kinds of algorithms are basically unbreakable -- it takes years, if not
millennia to do so -- and forward secrecy makes that useless

#### Problems -- What are the problems I learned about

- like any tool, it can also be misused -- can be used to hide crimes and even commit them
- Facebook Messenger is supposed to become more private and more secure
- this would make the detection of illegal content more difficult
- high numbers of _cse_ and _terrorism_ on FB and FBM -- __big problem for LEA
if all of that gets encrypted__
- because of how high social media use is and how many people use Facebook,
    this issue will have a high impact, regardless of the solution 

#### Debate -- the debate caused by problems I learned about

- how can LEA access information while not weakening the security of everyone?
- debate started in the '90s -- no solution was found back then
- _privacy vs security_ is the fundamental question here
- Crypto Wars -- old debate
    - weak encryption: bad because it is always weak
    - key-escrow: has many problems with management of keys and implementation
    - mostly driven by crime like cse, digital theft, money laundering etc
    - __FB proposal is not compatible with these measures__
- EU approach -- new debate in the EU, still ongoing
    - supports encryption -- strong and without key-escrow
    - seeks alternative measures: breaking encryption, cooperation between LEA,
    training programs
    - EU debate is driven by terrorism, not crime like cse
    - terrorism is also a priority for EU citizens
    - __this approach is actually compatible with FB's proposal__

#### Solutions -- proposed solutions to the problem I found

- EU approach differs from the failed earlier approach
- they support encryption
- access would be situational and there would be no weakness introduced into
the system for LEA's sake 
- it will be difficult to break encryption, cooperate effectively with other
national LEA
- is it too hypocritical to break encryption and celebrate it at the same time?
- how well this will even work remains to be seen
