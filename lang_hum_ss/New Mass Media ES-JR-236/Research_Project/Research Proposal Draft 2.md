# Outline

## Introduce the topic

- cyber crime is a huge issue in today's world, the costs are immense and the
  crimes committed are heinous, terrorism...
- this prompts governments to ask for "exceptional access" to information
- this has a host of problems, see keys under doormats
- recently Facebook's proposal to make Messenger a end-to-end encrypted service
  made waves when the UK and US send a letter to Zuckerberg asking him to wait
  for policy decisions because they are anxious
- law enforcement has warned of going dark, but they really didn't, so that was
  a lie
- snowden papers etc made it clear that they could collect more data than ever
  before
- the surveillance is already pretty much everywhere
- criminals could just switch to services that still use strong encryption, and
  then only law abiding citizens would be in peril
- facebook made it easier to commit these crimes
- the agencies responsible for dealing e.g. with sexual exploitation are
  already overloaded and underfunded, so even more data would not really make
  anything better, sadly
- the cloud act is affecting this how?
- is messenger's encryption really so bad when it already has encryption? Yes,
  as right now it does not support groups and other stuff
- 18 million reported cases a year is a lot, but what share of the total amount
  of data is it?
- Europol also sees encryption as a problem, as it allows criminals to hide
  their tracks and to keep important data from law enforcement
- The EU is actually both hailing encryption and damning it at the same time,
  which is hilariously hypocritical
- there is a lot of work being done on something that could be called
  a compromise or something
-------
- Facebook announcing to make Messenger more secure and the international
  response to that are a reminder that this issue is still not solved
- explain the problem in the case of facebook and the CLOUD Act
- Europol and ENISA signed an agreement to not push for backdoors, while at the
  same time denouncing encryption
- 

# Analytical Research Paper: 
- What is the encryption debate?
- What is the current status of the encryption debate in the EU?
- Is there a solution in sight?

- what is all the fuss about?
    - the standard debate summarized
    - why won't backdoors work?
- what is it in the EU that is so interesting?
    - EU is both saying that it is fundamental and an obstacle for fighting
      crime?
- what is the EU proposing to do instead?
    - the commission proposes to develop measures to break encryption without
      weakening it
    - we have seen how well that can work out with the NSA etc...
