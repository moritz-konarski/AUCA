# Research Proposal

- thesis:
    - __summarize main point and previews supporting points__
- is there a puzzle to study/solve?
    - how can we solve the issue of fighting crime online while preserving the
      privacy of the users?
    - is there an approach to solving this problem? Maybe the strange Medium
      article?
- outline:
    - hello
    - there
- primary and secondary resources:
    - xkcd

## The encryption debate:

- how realistic are the fears of law enforcement?
    - are they really "going dark"
    - snowden papers showed something different
    - the patriot act and other surveillance acts in the UK
    - they can now collect more data than ever before
- how big is the problem really?
    - ciber crime is a huge issue in our time, very expensive
    - the amount of fraud, sexual exploitation and terrorism is immense
- is their proposed solution viable?
    - but would weakening encryption really work?
    - wouldn't hardened criminals just move to still encrypted services,
      leaving only law abiding people vulnerable?
    - but it is undeniable that stuff like facebook has made it a lot easier to
      do crime
    - but also, the federal agencies are already overloaded and understaffed,
      so giving them more info and more data doesn't really solve anything
      without a structural change
- facebook with their massenger encryption -> how does it relate to the problem
    - it's just the latest piece in this puzzle, drew condemnation from
      political entities
- the cloud act: how does it play into the whole situation?
    - just the most recent act that is now relevant

- Is the plan of Facebook to implement end-to-end encryption really going to
  be as bad as UK and US claim it to be?
- messenger already has a feature for end-to-end encryption: secret
  conversations
- but it does not have group convos or voice and video calling
- facebook can actually decrypt your secret conversations if you report them?
  Maybe decrypt or your device and then send to facebook
- they would just make it the standard
- the letter criticizes that because of the usual chatter about crime
- how large is the number of cases that facebook does not catch/that don't
  happen on facebook?
- there is a real dilemma here, but we need to keep the bigger picture in mind,
  where 18 million cases a year is nothing compared to the total amount of
  messages and content
- this comes down to whether or not one wants to sacrifice everyone's privacy
  for a good thing

------
- Think of data to help you illustrate/explain/support your thesis statement
- introduce your thesis statement
- first ask yourself: is there any puzzle to solve
- choose approach: analytical, explanatory, argumentative
- make an outline
- list key primary and secondary resources
