Final Exam Questions New Mass Media
===================================

Moritz Konarski, 18.12.2019

#### 1. New mass media are predominantly digital, which is a blessing and a curse at the same time. Please explain what are the main benefits of digital media and what also are the biggest threats/risks associated with them.

The digital, distributed nature of new mass media is probably its
biggest strength and weakness at the same time. Many online services are
free to use if one has an internet connection and a device that can
access the web. This makes internet use very easy and cheap, allowing
many people to participate. Additionally, the internet is available in
most areas worldwide, allowing communication and the global sharing of
ideas. Such new mass media can reach more people than ever before,
contributing to a global exchange of ideas. Furthermore, ideas can
spread very easily across the internet because most platforms are
interconnected. This allows a funny tweet to not only become popular on
Twitter, but also on Facebook, Instagram or Reddit. Another advantage of
new mass media is that traditional gatekeepers (in old forms of media
like TV, radio, newspapers) do not exists on the internet. This allows
people to publish what they want.

This easy spreading of ideas and absence of gatekeepers has downsides,
too. Because ideas spread so easily, factually incorrect ones or harmful
ones spread easily, too. In combination with the absence of gatekeepers
moderating content, this can and does lead to falsehoods being shared.
These falsehoods, if they are subtle, will spread before being noticed
and do considerable damage. This disadvantage ties into another one,
that verifying the truthfulness of online content is difficult and (I
would bet) most people do not do that. Finding the original source of a
statement can take time and difficult because even reputable news
agencies cite other news agencies citing other news agencies etc. If
even they are hard to fact-check, the average Facebook user is
impossible to fact-check without putting more effort than most people
would be willing to.

#### 3. What is media literacy and why it is a vital skill nowadays? Please discuss at least 3 cases in which it needs to be applied and why.

According to Wikipedia, "Media literacy encompasses the practices that
allow people to access, critically evaluate, and create or manipulate
media." ([1. Wikipedia - Media
literacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Media_literacy)). Part of this
is the process of identifying the author, purpose, point of view, and
representation (bias, propaganda, censorship) of a piece of content ([2.
Wikipedia - Media literacy
eductation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Media_literacy#Media_literacy_education)).

-   all of those points are important:
    -   access is how you get the media
    -   critical evaluation is always important, but for new media this
        can be hard
    -   creation and manipulation are also important -- even if it's
        just to know how others would do it

1.  seeing a post shared by a friend
    -   who authored the post?
    -   who is the audience?
    -   techniques that were used
2.  reading a news article on a controversial topic
3.  watching an election advertisement on TV or online
