# Facebook Messenger -- A Threat to Public Safety?

## Introduction

### Hook - Facebook Statement

_Facebook proposes common-sense privacy goals for their messaging services --
encryption and reduced permanence_

- In May Mark Zuckerberg announced that Facebook Messenger would become more
  secure in the future. Facebook plans to implement secure encryption into its
  private messaging service to ...
- short description of the note -- __give the two main principles__
- this proposal seems very sensible, especially in a time where Facebook is
  not known for protecting privacy, as Mark Zuckerberg remarks in
  a self-aware way.

### EU connection

_The European Commission holds encryption to be highly important to digital
infrastructure and fundamental rights_

- The EU also sees this importance, they see encryption as a vital tool for
  everything that is important. 
- state the importance of encryption here: online banking, private messaging,
  cloud data storage, online shopping
- Still, not everyone agrees that encryption and Facebook's proposals are
  a good idea

### Counter Statement

_US, UK, Australian governments hold that encryption -- especially on Facebook
Messenger -- can be a threat to public safety if it stops LEA from doing their jobs_

- The ministers of the US, UK, and Australia wrote an open letter to
  Facebook and Mark Zuckerberg urging them not to go forward with their
  plans outlined in the note.
- concern over criminals evading LEA, _think of the children_
- the main idea is that privacy should not be put above security

### EU connection

_EU organizations like Europol and national LEA see encryption as a tool used
by bad actors -- mostly terrorists -- to commit or organize their crimes_

- how is this different from the open letter approach
- Even though the European Commission hails encryption, some other bodies
  of the EU are not so enthusiastic. Europol sees encryption as one of the
  major threats to their counter-terrorism work.
- give counter points that were made by EU institutions
- the EU political discussion is mostly concerned with encryption as a tool
  for terrorists

### Summary and Research Question

_Why is encryption so important and devisive?_

- it is both a huge asset and liability at the same time
- within the EU there is no concrete consensus on the issue
- questions that need to answered:
    - What is encryption and what is the general debate about?
    - What exactly is Facebook proposing and why is it a problem for LEA?
    - Contrasting the EU approach with the Open Letter approach
    - Is there a way to find a European solution?

## Body

### What is encryption and what is the general debate about?

#### What is encryption?

_Encryption is the act of making data unreadable to outsiders -- allows secure
and confidential communications_

- Encryption is putting data in code, make messages unreadable for potential
  snoopers
- __reiterate why it is important__
- example of % of people using the [internet graph][1] and/or internet usage for
  sm europe
- use the OECD guidelines and examples/explanations
- Encryption allows data to be privately and securely transmitted globally.

_Source_: OECD guidelines

#### General Issue

_LEA want access to data to do their jobs -- if that data is encrypted, they
have a hard time doing their jobs_

- what is _exceptional access_
- LEA want access to data, if they don't have it they fear that they cannot do
  their job correctly
- They want exceptional access to data
- One of the main issues in the EU is terrorism while in the US and UK it's cse
- how much citizens see terrorism as a problem open data cyber security
- these are valid concerns, but how do they want to do it?

#### Methods of exceptional access

_Exceptional Access of LEA -- historically -- can be facilitated through backdoors or weak
encryption_

- encryption is being used, so they have to deal with that somehow
- mention the Crypto Wars in passing
- backdoors are the storing of keys with third parties that can then be
  retrieved when LEA needs them -- more precisely called key-escrow
- has the issue of organization, security principles, one big target for
  attacks
- the other is weak encryption -- stuff that is easy to break -- meaning that
  LEA does not need to get a key, they can just crack it

### What exactly is Facebook proposing and why is it a problem for LEA?

#### Encryption and Reduced Permanence

_Facebook wants to make private messages e2e encrypted and reduce the time that
the message data is stored to increase privacy_

- this is supposed to increase the feeling of a living room vs the current town
  hall
- they see a trend and shifting public opinion on data storage and big groups
- peoples opinions on privacy focused networks/fear of public
  exposure/trustworthy networks from barometers
- Mark acknowledges the problems this might have, but thinks that it's still
  the way to go
- connect to the previous paragraphs on encryption

_Sources_: Facebook Note

#### Issues for LEA

_Data that is not accessible and stored for short periods of time make it more
difficult to fight crime_

- encryption makes it difficult to access data that is needed to fight crime
- there is a lot of crime on the internet
- connect it specifically to Facebook and their proposals
- specifically cse from Open letter and NYT
- Facebook acknowledges that it will be hard to do with e2ee

_Sources_: Facebook Note, Open Letter, OECD, NYT cse piece

#### Proposing backdoors in the Open letter 

_Facebook should provide access to users' data in a readable and usable format
-- backdoors into their encryption_

- see above in general discussion on backdoors what kind of mess this would be
- it would invalidate the whole idea that Zuckerberg was proposing
- OECD guidelines and the problems the reference in connection to this proposal

_Source_: OECD guidelines, Open Letter, Keys Under Doormats

### Contrasting the EU approach with the Open Letter approach

#### Reasons for the debate

_While the open letter takes cse as the main reason, the EU uses terrorism 
as the main reason_

- terror attacks in Europe and the following debate --  how it started
- Open Letter is more of a continuation of the Crypto Wars than a new thing
- does that ultimately make a difference?
- security alliance and CLOUD ACT on UK side as well

_Source_: Open Letter, Debate Summary, Keys Under Doormats

#### The European Approach

_The EU holds encryption to be very important and does not endorse weakening or
backdoors_

- state where the EU says that encryption is important
- where do they say they will not try to weaken or backdoor it
- even Europol and ENISA agree that they will not push for that
- this precludes both common practices that were discussed previously

_Sources_: 11th progress report, Debate Summary, ENISA-Europol agreement

#### Possible alternatives

_Because the ususal routes of regulating encryption are not open to the EU,
they focus on different things -- workarounds and other strengthening_

- regardless of the previous statement, Europol and ntl LEA are not crazy about
  encryption so they have to do something
- example of circumvention would be FBI cracking San Bernadino shooter's phone
  without Apple's help
- debate summary on their plans, also 11th progress report
- strengthen Europol, national LEA, expert networks, cross-border cooperation
- they want to circumvent the problem if they can
- or Germany using viruses to get data before it can even be encrypted

_Sources_: 11th report, debate summary

#### Issues with that approach

_The area is pretty uncharted and the countries might not work together
effectively_

- toolbox sharing might be difficult
- citizens state that they do want LEA to share info to solve crimes
- capabilities are very different
- there aren't really any laws about state hacking and that stuff
- it is a contradiction to support encryption and still try to beat it
- lack of transparency in the state capabilities, laws, EU procedures
- no EU mandate to really enforce any measures like that

_Sources_: debate summary, Keys under doormats?

#### Results so far

_The debate is pretty young, so there are few actual results, but moslty
strengthening Europol_

- EP gets more money to improve their hacking capabilities
- national LEA are trained
- expert networks are created
- the conviction that a solution exists is there
- because terrorism was there at the start, the debate is less focused than it
  should be

----------

## Summary and outlook

_It seems like there is no clear solution in sight_

- interesting to see the EU taking such a different approach to the whole topic
- good to see fundamental rights being upheld by their approach
- as such they probably chose the most difficult path and the least trodden one
