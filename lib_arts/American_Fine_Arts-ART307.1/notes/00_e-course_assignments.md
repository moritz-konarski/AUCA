## What is significant about Benjamin West’s painting The death of general Wolfe?

This picture is very dramatic in its depiction of the death of general Wolfe. 
The lighting, arrangement of the people and their poses contribute to this.      

According to Wikipedia, the painting shows Wolfe dying after winning the 
battle of Quebec. Because it shows him basically giving his life for victory, 
the suggestion of martyrdom is very clear. It is also significant that this 
shows people that were not present at the scene, breaking with standards of 
historical painting.

## What aspect of American life does Benjamin West’s painting Treaty of Penn with Indians present? How is this aspect presented?

The painting shows a group of settlers and natives meeting under a tree. In 
the background we can see colonial houses and ongoing construction, probably a 
settlement. The group is split, with the settlers on the left and the natives 
on the right side of the painting. In the middle men from both groups talk, 
while onlookers watch from the left and right sides of the painting. The group 
in the middle and thus their activity is the focus of the painting.        

The painting depicts the two groups entering into a peace treaty (Wikipedia). 
This shows that the two groups could interact with each other in a peaceful 
manner (even though the were at war before).               

The painting depicts this in a balanced manner, both sides are given a similar 
amount of space and neither is portrayed with an obvious bias (at least to me).

## Compare the two paintings by John Trumbull The death of general Montgomery and The sortie made by the British garrison of Gibraltar. What paradox does the comparison reveal?

Both paintings are very similar in their composition. The background or sky is 
very dark and lacks detail. The light in the pictures comes from the left side 
and is focused on the object of the painting. These details combined make the 
object of the painting stand out from everything else (Montgomery and the 
British garrison/the dying soldier).                      

The paradox here is that, as an American artist, Trumbull painted a heroic 
American general (as one might expect), but also a victory of the British 
troops in the Independence War. This is not something that I would have 
expected because the British were enemies of the Americans. One explanation 
might be that the focus of the painting is on the Spanish officer and not the 
British (Wikipedia), thus depicting heroism and maybe martyrdom. This would be 
consistent with the first painting, which shows a general dying in the fight 
against British troops.

## Compare the portraits of George Washigton by Gilbert Stuart, John Trumbull, Charles Peale. Which is the most popular in the US? Why?

In all three pictures Washington stands in a similar pose, mostly upright and 
looking to the left. In Trumbull and Stuart's pictures he also has his right 
arm stretched out, holding a telescope. In Peale and Trumbull's pictures he is 
wearing a military uniform because those pictures show him at the sight of a 
battle, while Stuart paints him dressed formally and in a richly decorated 
room.             

I would say that the portrait by Stuart is the most popular portrait of 
Washington because it shows the kind of statesman America wanted to see at the 
time of its creation. Maybe they did not want a general anymore, but a 
statesman that would lead the new country successfully. Because Stuart's 
painting shows that, it became the most popular one of the three.

## What is the story behind John Vanderlyn’s painting The death of JaneMacCrea? How can his painting be interpreted?

The painting shows two native Americans killing a non-native woman with 
tomahawks. The woman is kneeling on the ground being held down by the two 
attackers. Just looking at the painting one would assume that the woman is 
being killed for no good reason because the picture does not show any and that 
the natives are unquestionably to blame.             

According to Wikipedia though, this might not have been the case. While one 
version of the story fits the impression this picture gives, another version 
of the events describes McCrea being killed by bullets fired at the three of 
them by pursuing American soldiers. There is also uncertainty about why she 
was with the native warriors in the first place, either because they kidnapped 
her, or because her fiance asked them to escort her.This painting only depicts 
one specific version of these events and sends a pretty clear message by doing 
so.

## How can you interpret J. Vanderlyne’s painting Landing of Columbus?

This painting focuses on Columbus and his men, shortly after they arrive on 
land. He is standing in a very noble pose, with his sword by his side and a 
flag raised towards the sky. He is also looking towards the sky. The clothes 
or armor of the men is shiny and clean, making them look noble and imposing. 
In the background the artist shows natives cowering and fleeing from Columbus 
and his men.              

This painting glorifies the journey and arrival of Columbus and his men. The 
focus of the painting is completely on them and not the natives or the actual 
land they discovered. They are depicted as noble in shining armor and standing 
upright, while the natives (in the background) are naked, cowering and fleeing.

## What are the story, art style, and reception of John Vanderlyn's painting Araidne on the Island of Naxos?

The painting shows a naked Ariadne sleeping under a tree. The whole scene is 
pretty dark, maybe because it takes place at dusk or dawn. Ariadne is the 
daughter of King Minos of Crete from Greek mythology. She fell in love with 
Theseus from Athens and ran with him to the island of Naxos. There, he 
abandoned her while she slept. 
(https://www.nyhistory.org/exhibit/ariadne-asleep-island-naxos)         

The painting has a classical reference and theme. This conformed to the taste 
of Napoleonic France and he hoped to make money with this painting. There was 
an exhibition of female nudes where he was successful in getting attention. 
While there was an outcry of disapproval, people would pay to see it anyways.

## What are the differences between the Federal and the Colonial period?

The colonial period mostly had portraits of rich merchants as there was little 
else to do and there were no American subjects. Most of the artists were 
British and all foreign because there was no art schooling in America.    

As that began to change, American born artists began to emerge, but they were 
still trained in Europe. Now they had more American subjects to paint, so they 
started doing that. The War of Independence created new subjects and a needs 
for art and I'd assume it made some artists want to distance themselves from 
the old colonial masters. Now we see portraits of politicians and battles that 
were American in artist and subject. As we said, art needs stimulus - the war 
was one for sure.

## Why was the landscape genre popular in the United States around the middle of the 19th century?

The landscape genre of painting was popular in the US at that time because of 
multiple factors. Firstly, the landscape of the US was something that set it 
apart from Europe through its untouched beauty. The potential of this 
untouched land that settlers saw and its beauty may have made people want to 
paint it or own paintings of it. Especially for people that would probably 
never see it for themselves this seems desirable.          

Another factor is that people in the eastern US started to reminisce about 
how the land there used to look before humans started changing it. Thus 
pictures that showed untouched land and provided contrast to the present were 
popular.

## How can you interpret Thomas Cole's allegoric series of paintings by Cole Course of Empire and The Voyage of Life. Which of the two was more understandable to broad American public and why? What is the meaning and the tone of these two series? 

The Course of Empire, a series of 5 paintings, shows the stages that an empire 
progresses through in Cole's opinion. This series was inspired by ruins of 
empires Cole saw when traveling Europe in 1829. The five stages are Savage, 
Pastoral, Consummation of the Empire, Destruction of the Empire, and 
Desolation. All 5 pictures show the same distinct mountain that allows the 
viewer to easily see that all pictures show the same place at different times.          

The series describes the path an empire might take, starting at Savage. The 
progress starts at undeveloped, unwelcoming lands and continues to welcoming, 
peaceful settlements. The next step shows a sprawling empire with Greek or 
Roman architecture celebrating in abundance. Destruction shows the same city 
being burned and plundered resulting in Desolation, where nature starts to 
reclaim the land. These paintings could be seen as Cole's impression of the 
ruins of Europe that he saw during his travels and possibly a warning to the 
US not to go down the same path. It represents the life cycle as Cole 
perceived it.           

The Voyage of Life, a series of 4 paintings, Childhood, Youth, Manhood, and 
Old Age, illustrate 4 stages of life. It starts out with Childhood, where an 
angel is seen steering a boat with a small child in it down a river. The 
landscape is green, the sun is rising and the whole scene looks almost like a 
dream. Progressing to Youth, the boy has now taken over the boat and left the 
angel at the side of the river, it is now day (maybe late morning) and he is 
gesturing towards a literal castle in the sky far off in the distance. Manhood 
shows the man approaching rapids, praying for help while his angel watches 
from up high. the scene is very gloomy and it's now dusk. Old Age shows the 
now old man arriving at a calm ocean while the angel is pointing towards the 
lit-up sky, as if to show him the way. Here we have another description of a 
life cycle, but this time it's the human life that is being described.         

Both series of paintings are metaphors and contain many visual metaphors too. 
The symbolism of The Voyage of Life is a lot clearer and easier to understand 
because one human lifetime is something that a lot of people will experience 
themselves and they can see all stages of it around them. The life cycle of an 
empire takes hundreds of years and is not something that the average person 
can really emphasize with. This means that The Voyage of Life was more 
understandable for the average person because they could easily understand 
what it was describing and thus it became more popular.

## What is similar to Cole, Church, and Bierstadt in painting nature? And what makes them different in terms what landscape they painted?

They all depict epic or memorable landscapes using dramatic lighting. Cole 
sometimes had some kind of moral message in his paintings, for example in his 
two big series. He showed people and stories to make the paintings more like 
history paintings, which he saw as superior art. Furthermore, he painted 
fictional landscapes.              

Bierstadt was more focused on the landscape itself and making it as 
magnificent and large as he could, he placed animals and people in the 
pictures to give the viewer a sense of their scale. He painted real landscapes 
and often ones he saw himself.               

Church (judging from the pictures on e-course) painted landscapes that had no 
visible living things in them and in the two pictures we have on e-course the 
lighting is even more dramatic than other paintings.

## Kensett, Bingham and Gifford used the luminist approach in the paintings uploaded in this section. What is characteristic of this approach? 

Luminism focuses on the effects that light has on a landscape. It was an 
American painting style from the 1850s to 1870s. Their paintings show calm 
landscapes and water with soft skies and the interactions of light with them. 
Their style is relatively realistic and doesn't really show who painted it 
(to me it seems like it would be hard to recognize specific artists).

## What kind of America emerges in this painting by Bingham?

In this relatively gloomy painting Bingham shows two fur traders going down 
the river Missouri in a small canoe. They also have their cat on a leash with 
them. An old man is sitting at the back steering be boat while a young man, 
possible a native tracker, lays on a stack of fur.         

In this picture two normal, probably relatively poor people are painted going 
about their daily lives and nothing about it is magnificent. The focus is also 
not on the relatively uneventful landscape. This is new because earlier 
pictures focused on rich people, significant people and their deeds, and 
scenic landscapes. This picture doesn't have any of that, making it different. 
I would say that the kind of America emerging in this picture is that of the 
normal people that didn't do anything heroic or historically significant in 
order to be painted.

## Comment on an American landscape painting by an American artist from the 19th century

New England Scenery is a 1851 painting by Frederic E. Church. I chose this 
painting because of the high level of detail, idyllic, mostly untouched 
landscape, and the depiction of human influence on this landscape. I would 
like to elaborate on this in class.
