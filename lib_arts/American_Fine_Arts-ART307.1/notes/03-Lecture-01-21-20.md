## Homework -- Early Federal Period

### Grand Manner

- [Wikipedia - Grand manner][Wiki-Grand-manner]
- idealized aesthetic style derived from classicism and High Renaissance
- in 18th century used by British artists to describe paintings with visual
metaphors that suggest noble qualities
- Sir Joshua Reynolds made it popular through lecture at the Royal Academy from
1769 to 1790 -- painters should perceive their subjects through generalization
and idealization and not careful copy of nature
- originally regarding history painting, later also portrait painting
- portraits showed subjects life size and full-length, surroundings conveyed
the nobility and elite status of the subjects
- common background elements: classical architecture (sophistication,
cultivation), pastoral backgrounds (virtuous character, unpretentious, sincere,
undefiled by wealth and estates)

## Notes -- Early Federal Period

- colonial artists: Smibert, Blackburn, Hesselis -- mostly British artists
- federal artists: _John Copley_, Charles Peale, Benjamin West -- American-born
artists
- Copley was very talented, while he started out as an American artist, when
the war broke out he went to England because his family had loyalist
connections
- his family was in danger, a mod came to his house
- in Britain he painted British history in order to get by and fit in
- The Death of Major Pierson -- big painting of British history shows the
British winning against the French
- very colorful painting

The Death of Major Pearson - John Copley

- he was a hard working artist, until his death in London
- he started out as a colonial artist, became a federal artist
- Peale was also an important artist, painted his own museum etc.

The Artist in His Museum - Charles Peale

- he painted George Washington, but the first painting was not accepted because
it was not what the new country wanted in a hero -- even though it was probably
accurate
- the portrait was not accepted even thought it was a good portrait, it was not
statesman-like enough
- Benjamin West was a colonial artist, found a donor and went to Europe to
study art there
- he becomes famous for his art in Britain and becomes the President of the
Royal Academy as an American-born artist
- he never forgot where he came from though, he helped out many other American
artists like Trumbull etc.
- looking at a picture by West of a peace treaty, we commented on it [here][ecourse-forum]
- a nice amount of plagiarism in the answers here, people just copy shit
- as it turns out, there is no text of the treaty, there are no real records of
the meeting -- we only know that the painting was commissioned by the son of
the founder of Pennsylvania, who had certain motives when he commissioned the
painting
- it might have been an example of peaceful resolution, but that is not certain
- maybe the dress of the settlers is more conservative and maybe a symbol of
more sophistication -- the clothing might not be appropriate for the time, so
that may show bias against the natives when the Europeans are portrayed as
civilized and the natives are not
- the acquisition of land was not violent, but it was by deception and not fair
