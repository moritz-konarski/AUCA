- __Benjamin West__ was an American artist who went to Great Britain and became
a British artist and then, out of necessity, started painting British
historical paintings
- his patriotism: his allegiance is with art, and he will work in any country
that allows them to do what he want, he is not a political painter
- then we looked at the answers to "What is significant about Benjamin West's
painting The death of general Wolfe?"
- the painting glorifies the death of the general, it was not exactly accurate
- in these kinds of paintings people would generally wear Greek or Roman
clothes to show class and history, he refused to do that and just paints normal
clothes that would be appropriate for the time
- stuff like diagonals are used to show movement, typical baroque stuff
- the native in the picture looks on with a certain admiration or sorrow and
that would probably not have been the case -- but you have to appease the
public
- __John Trumbull__ learned from Benjamin West, but he had more movement and
went further than West, was an aid to Washington and had the rank of major
- the fate of an artist and his allegiances is seen when comparing his
paintings of Montgomery and the Gibraltar sortie -- first he was an officer and
then he resigned because of a dispute about rank and payment
- classical painting style in colors and dynamics, also classical
- Vanderlyn is an American artist and that copied classical artists and he
painted in a classical style
- we don't want to be people without ties to history :p
