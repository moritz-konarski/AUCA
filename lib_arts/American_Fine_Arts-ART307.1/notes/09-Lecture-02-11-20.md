## Notes

### Romanticism

- _Dances With Wolves_ embodies romanticism, landscapes, and Manifest Destiny
- it was very powerful in Europe, in America it was a hero that went to
untouched lands (in the movie)
- European examples: Goethe, Haydn, Tschaikovsky...
- Dunbar is happy with an outpost without people in the middle of nowhere, he
likes living away from civilization -- romantic
- Manifest Destiny meant that land was taken away from the natives and never
given back
- _Wounded Knee_ (see [source][history-wounded-knee]) was a massacre that
killed over 150 natives in a conflict with U.S. Army soldiers, _Dances With
Wolves_ hints at something like that at the end of the movie
- _George Catlin:_ painted native Americans after he retired from being
a lawyer while most people viewed them as a nuisance
- all his paintings have the same kind of expression on their faces
- he took an ethnographic approach to painting them
- _Wee-Sheet Stugeon's Head, a Fox warrior_ shows colors, hairstyle, earrings,
bracelets, red and white hands
- _Keokuk (The Watchful Fox), chief of the tribe_ shows more clothing and
style, weapons, armor, metallurgy etc
- reservations still exist, some natives leave the reservations and join
mainstream society, many of them don't though
- native reservations have a ton of problems with poverty and drugs and stuff

### Genre Painting

- shows scenes from everyday life, generally country life
- __the paintings contained messages that the viewer should learn__
- it was popular because the country was still one of farmers and most
Americans were living in rural areas
- European life was seen as mostly decadent and American cities were heaped in
with that
- this more relatable topic was more popular with farmers and stuff
- _Dancing on the Barn Floor_ -- William Mount, 1831
- barns were of course common and thus painting stuff in it is liked
- _The Banjo Player_ showed Black Americans and a banjo in his paintings
- _The Truant Gamblers_ shows boys skipping school, drinking something out of
a flask (possibly cider), gambling, and a man carrying a stick is rounding the
corner to teach them a lesson
- people could see themselves in these pictures which made them more popular
- _The Power of Music_ showed a black farm worker listening to white men
playing fiddle in a kind of barn
- _The Sportsman's Last Visit_ shows two men courting the same woman and the
gentleman seems to win the battle, attempting to teach that what women prefer
brains?
- _Loss and Gain_ shows an old drunk stumbling through a forest and dropping
his drink (the loss), but gains a chance at sobriety (gain)

### Luminist-Romantic-Genre Painting

- _The Jolly Flatboatmen in Port_ -- George Caleb Bingham
- shows common people dancing and frolicking on a boat, luminist style
- _Daniel Boone Escoring Settlers_ shows determined people moving towards a new
life, they are armed and the nature is pretty wild -- a determined party of
Americans that want to claim the land and make it prosper
- he also painted elections, e.g. _The Verdict of the People_ or _The County
Election_, common people vote in that picture, but there is also a drunk in 
the front plus a bunch of other people drinking
- there are no women or people of color in the picture because they were not 
allowed to vote
- people of color make appearances now, he also copied things from European
paintings which were now widely available
- _Order No. 11_ shows the Union soldiers committing kind of war crimes,
Bingham hated Gen. Ewing who is shown in the painting and drafted Order No. 11
