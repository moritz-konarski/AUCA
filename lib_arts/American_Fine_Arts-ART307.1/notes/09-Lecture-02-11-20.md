### William Sidney Mount -- Historic and Political Art (p. 221-224)

- common things in life were seen as American and worthy, even though foreign
visitors would decry them
- the new chapter America opened allowed people to think free from old
traditions and frameworks, opening new opportunities for thought
- museum were founded and new ways of thinking became prominent
- poetry and literature also experienced new developments, with many new works
being created, e.g. _Moby Dick_
- women's suffrage became a thing
- simple, homey scenes from rural areas provided the material for genre 
painting
- most people were rural, but the patrons of genre painting were urban, maybe
because they wanted to escape urban life and industrialization
- things were smaller and compared to Europe less pompous, fitting into the
idea of genre painting
- attended academy of design
- he tried biblical history painting, but it did not appeal to him
- rural subjects and music were important aspects of Mount's art
- Mount himself was a good fiddler and his brother was a composer $\rightarrow$
the liking of music is pretty clearly founded in something
- the recurring theme of a barn could be explained by the existence of a barn
in the town Mount lived in
- pictures were popular because the showed rural, good America vs the bad
citydwellers
- he put moral messages in his paintings, like the gambler one, and he also
covered them in a layer of humor from time to time

### Bingham -- The Western Frontier (p. 228-230)

- Bingham described what was going on around the Mississippi and Missouri
rivers as the frontier expanded to those lands
- see _Fur Traders Descending the Missouri_
- this is a new type of folk hero that was born from the land itself -- there
was no European counterpart -- this was uniquely American
- he also painted political pictures at the frontier
- there is greatness in the commonplace

### Leutze -- The Heroic Narrative (p. 231)

- heroic narratives were not popular because there was no one that would buy
the paintings and there was no pre-established cult of great persons
- Emanuel Leutze made a name for himself with his heroic paintings
- best remembered for _Washington Crossing the Delaware_, depicting heroic
Washington and his great military maneuver
- he was then commissioned by the Capitol, but that was not common at the time

### Horatio Greenough -- American Sculpture (p. 248-260)

- from a prominent Boston family, attended Harvard, got interested in sculpture
and then went to Italy to study it some
- went back to Florence and spent a long time there
- first big commission was for the Chanting Cherubs, which was not well
received in America because of the nudity that it showed
- he should have learned from this experience, but he did not
- then he was commissioned by the government to make a statue of George
Washington intended for the US Capitol rotunda
- he made a mix of a bust of Washington and the famous Zeus statue
- he made him like look greek and foreign to Americans
- the sculpture is noble and impressive (artistry and looks) but was ridiculed
because Americans did not feel like Washington needed anyone to represent him
but himself
- only few people actually appreciated his style of sculpture, he laid the
groundwork, but others would need to create works that resonated with more
people

## Notes

### Romanticism

- _Dances With Wolves_ embodies romanticism, landscapes, and Manifest Destiny
- it was very powerful in Europe, in America it was a hero that went to
untouched lands (in the movie)
- European examples: Goethe, Haydn, Tschaikovsky...
- Dunbar is happy with an outpost without people in the middle of nowhere, he
likes living away from civilization -- romantic
- Manifest Destiny meant that land was taken away from the natives and never
given back
- _Wounded Knee_ (see [source][history-wounded-knee]) was a massacre that
killed over 150 natives in a conflict with U.S. Army soldiers, _Dances With
Wolves_ hints at something like that at the end of the movie
- _George Catlin:_ painted native Americans after he retired from being
a lawyer while most people viewed them as a nuisance
- all his paintings have the same kind of expression on their faces
- he took an ethnographic approach to painting them
- _Wee-Sheet Stugeon's Head, a Fox warrior_ shows colors, hairstyle, earrings,
bracelets, red and white hands
- _Keokuk (The Watchful Fox), chief of the tribe_ shows more clothing and
style, weapons, armor, metallurgy etc
- reservations still exist, some natives leave the reservations and join
mainstream society, many of them don't though
- native reservations have a ton of problems with poverty and drugs and stuff

### Genre Painting

- shows scenes from everyday life, generally country life
- __the paintings contained messages that the viewer should learn__
- it was popular because the country was still one of farmers and most
Americans were living in rural areas
- European life was seen as mostly decadent and American cities were heaped in
with that
- this more relatable topic was more popular with farmers and stuff
- _Dancing on the Barn Floor_ -- William Mount, 1831
- barns were of course common and thus painting stuff in it is liked
- _The Banjo Player_ showed Black Americans and a banjo in his paintings
- _The Truant Gamblers_ shows boys skipping school, drinking something out of
a flask (possibly cider), gambling, and a man carrying a stick is rounding the
corner to teach them a lesson
- people could see themselves in these pictures which made them more popular
- _The Power of Music_ showed a black farm worker listening to white men
playing fiddle in a kind of barn
- _The Sportsman's Last Visit_ shows two men courting the same woman and the
gentleman seems to win the battle, attempting to teach that what women prefer
brains?
- _Loss and Gain_ shows an old drunk stumbling through a forest and dropping
his drink (the loss), but gains a chance at sobriety (gain)

### Luminist-Romantic-Genre Painting

- _The Jolly Flatboatmen in Port_ -- George Caleb Bingham
- shows common people dancing and frolicking on a boat, luminist style
- _Daniel Boone Escoring Settlers_ shows determined people moving towards a new
life, they are armed and the nature is pretty wild -- a determined party of
Americans that want to claim the land and make it prosper
- he also painted elections, e.g. _The Verdict of the People_ or _The County
Election_, common people vote in that picture, but there is also a drunk in 
the front plus a bunch of other people drinking
- there are no women or people of color in the picture because they were not 
allowed to vote
- people of color make appearances now, he also copied things from European
paintings which were now widely available
- _Order No. 11_ shows the Union soldiers committing kind of war crimes,
Bingham hated Gen. Ewing who is shown in the painting and drafted Order No. 11
