- _Washington Crossing the Delaware_ (Leutze) is being described, his stance and what
the picture shows
- it was a surprise attack on the British army by American continental forces
- inaccuracies: attack happened in the dark, there was no ice, the river was
not as wide, stances are not that useful in boats, horses were not on boats
- Leutze wanted to convey an idea or a sentiment and not a completely accurate
representation of history -- thus the changes he made were maybe understandable
and justifiable -- depending of your value-based judgement
- around that time (~1848) there was a revolution in Germany and Leutze may
have wanted to convey this idea of revolution to Germans
- Congress wanted a copy of that painting so Leutze made a copy of it
- the original was destroyed by a British bombing campaign in Bremen in WWII
- _Washinton's Crossing_ (Mort Kuenstler) is a more accurate version of events
- it does show Washington standing up in an impressive way and there is a torch
but it is a lot better than Leutze
- Leutze's _Empire Makes it's Way Westwards_ was commissioned by the state to
glorify this thing -- it is a pure propaganda thing
- it has parallels to a journey to the holy land
- Greek slave statue was popular when it first came to America -- even
religious groups went to see it
- to make the sculpture attractive he wrote a story about how the slave is
a true believer that is being exploited by Turk slavers (nonbelievers) -- this
made people want to go and see it
- if you explain or spin art in a certain way people can be made to like it
- American sculptors all lived in Europe and were trained there
- Aphrodite's sculpture by Rinehard(t?) is of great artistic beauty
- sculpture of Medea, who killed her own children to get back at her cheating
husband is also amazingly detailed
- John Rogers made sculptures of American scenes -- the fugitive's story is
about a black woman who fled from the south telling three men her story
- another sculpture is of a family playing checkers in a relaxed setting
- Palmer is another American sculptor that also made nude sculptures -- a white
woman captured by natives that has a different style than normal classical
sculptures
