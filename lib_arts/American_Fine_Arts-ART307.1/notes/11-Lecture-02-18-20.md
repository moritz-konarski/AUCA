## Presentation by Anastasiia on _Thomas Eakins_

- 1844 -- 1916
- born in Philadelphia
- studied drawing and fine arts at an academy, also anatomy and dissection
- studied art in Europe as well
- _William Rush Carving His Allegorical Figure of the Schuylkill River_,
1876-1877 
    - interestingly the focus is on the chair that has the nude model's clothes
    on it
    - the clothes thrown over the chair make the nudity more pronounced because
    it focuses on the undressing?
- _Swimming_, 1884-1885
    - 5 nude men that go swimming 
    - his own dog is also in the picture
- he was accused of voyeurism because he liked nude bodies so much
- _The Cross Clinic_, 1875
    - studying at a medical school where he later taught too
    - he painted himself with the students
    - painting a doctor with blood on their hands was not cool -- was not
    accepted for exhibition 
- his style was naturalistic and realistic as seen in the blood etc.
- _The Agnew Clinic_, 1889
    - was a portrait for the doctor to show him in his element I guess
    - he did not charge the doctor extra either
    - this painting does not have any blood
    - some people day that this painting is much more mature and less focused
    on being spectacular
- he also took photos of nude men and women in one picture etc
- he was ultimately sacked from his position at the academy because he showed
a nude male model to a mixed audience

## Notes

- not necessarily beautiful, but realistic and shows what is happening
- the art trends we are talking about now are generally also found in
literature
- _The Gift Outright_, Robert Frost -- generally a realist poet -- wrote this
nationalist and patriotic poem about how the Americans owned the land before
they were even Americans
- romanticism always emphasized feeling over reason
- _Snap the Whip_ by Winslow Homer shows village boys playing like they did,
that is how it was
- realism was criticized because it was not art meant to decorate, it wasn't
exactly pretty
- Winslow Homer also irritated people who wanted something beautiful from art
- art should open your eyes to things that are hidden and not just be beautiful
