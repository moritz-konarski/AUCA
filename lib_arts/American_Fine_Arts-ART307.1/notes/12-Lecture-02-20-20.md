- romanticism was about trusting your heart and not your mind
- feelings are important and the focus
- it's about inspiring different feelings, generally awe, admiration and beauty
- feeling of calm and serenity are romantic
- Homer and Eakins show facts of real life and they are not meant to show
emotions or feelings
- in realism feelings are not the thing to be expressed, the focus is on the
event that is happening

## The Outcasts of Poker Flat

- even the title gives some information about the story
- maybe not the generally expected outcasts -- they get banished in a moral
panic reaction from people in poker flat
- the town is kinda scared and upset because some valuables got stolen
- Oakhurst accepts fate because he is a gambler
- the women are of "easy virtue"
- Uncle Billy is a drunkard and a thief
- these people are not radical as one might expect, they engage in pretty
standard vice
- calling them outcasts gives them more credit than they would generally get
- this makes the story kinda romantic because realists would just state what
happened and not give them more credit and they wouldn't use humor either
- the Duchess cries, Mother Shipton curses, Uncle Billy curses like
a motherfucker -- all three of them let out their emotions
- Mr. Oakhurst could be the romantic hero -- he has romantic aims etc.
- we must go forward and do it in one go because we're in trouble if we stop 
and the weather changes on them
- the get snowed in in the mountains and thus are stuck there
- this story is not really realistic because there are a lot of feelings given
to the protagonists and all the deaths are pretty romantic

## Love of Life

- this story is not super romantic
- the fish catching was not romantic, just a description of what happens
- it is a realistic or naturalistic description of life

## Art

- _The daughters of Edward Darley_ is realism because is shows just the
children dressed in similar clothing
- he plays with colors: white dresses, white-blue vases, blue carpet, blue on
the cupboard, red in a divider thing
- transition from a realistic mode to a more artistic expression
- _Portrait of Madame X_ plays with color: black dress accentuates her white
skin, dark sepia background focuses on white skin, fits brown table
- _The white girl_ or _Symphony in white No. 1_ 
- Whistler said that he did not want people to read too much into his paintings
- here he is playing with white: white background, dress, skin, dark hair as
contrast
- he wanted people to read it as an experiment with color, not something else
- _Mother_ by Whistler also plays with color, gray background, black dress, but
white scarf, skin, and painting on the wall
- _Nocturne in Black and Gold_ or _The Falling Rocket_ was weird and a popular
art critic accused Whistler of throwing paint into the public's face, while
Whistler maintained that he painted it and that it was artistic expression
- Mary Cassatt was interested in color and light as well as water
- she painted women pretty often and idealized domestic roles of women -- while
also being an advocate of women's rights
- at the time women could hardly be artists, even in Europe it took a while,
but she was accepted at some point
