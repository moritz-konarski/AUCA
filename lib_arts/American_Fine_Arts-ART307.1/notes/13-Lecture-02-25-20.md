- finish up Impressionism, then start American Renaissance 
- towards the end of the 19th century we see a multitude of styles
- competition of different styles
- Impressionism came as a reaction to Realism
- Childe Hassam is the quintessential American impressionist painter
- Hassam chose to use Impressionism for _Union Square_ and _Avenue in the Rain_
because he wanted to show a certain spirit or idea and not individual faces or
specific things
- Impressionism was ridiculed and hated at first because people thought it was
trash -- later it became more accepted because it was something new and not the
same old stuff again
- earlier people went to Great Britain for training, also to Italy
- later people went to France because everything was happening in France and
that's where the style was at
- Monet and Manet painted all kinds of stuff
- Monet painted the British Parliament many times from the same perspective but
in different conditions of course
- both Realism and Impressionism want to show something real that they see
before their eyes -- just in different styles
- realists made sketches and then painted the final work in their studio
- impressionists would paint pictures in the moment and outside
- impressionism is a good style to paint certain kinds of things, not good for
specific people or actions because one would probably not recognize them and
how they painted would not be compatible with how they painted
- American Renaissance might be a reaction to unbridled capitalism because
people yearned back to a time that had values and stuff
