# Men as Success Objects and Women as Sex Objects - Simon Davis

## Notes

### Introduction by someone else

- unobstrusive method of conducting research: analyzing personal ads in
  newspapers -> after the fact, so no influence on the researchers part
- used 'Chi-square' to distinguish correlation from causation, to establish
  meaningful statistical relationships

### Introduction and previous research

- people choose partners according to old sex stereotypes, men put greater
  emphasis on attractiveness and sexuality, was also found across cultures
- strongest gender difference may be the importance/emotional investment that
  genders place in sex (women do it more)
- women tend to emphasize psychological characteristics and personality,
  commitment, longevity
- women may also seek financial security, men are treated as __success
  objects__, men sometimes reinforce that stereotype by preferring
  a traditional family structure
- men were traditionally more dominant intellectually, they don't really look
  for prowess and women sometimes hide it intentionally
- one process is matching, were people looking for certain characteristics were
  more likely to have those characteristics themselves, 'like attracts like'
- partners tend to resemble each other in various ways
- tradeoffs may be made, women offer domestic work and sex in return for
  financial support
- both sexes believe that the other expects them to live up to the gender
  stereotype
- women might just want to have a commited relationship and security instead of
  the perfect partner
- previous studies found men are more likely to look for attractiveness; women
  for financial security, personality traits
- now Davis wants to check if this is still true

### Method

- using a popular, conservative, respectable newspaper, should represent
  mainstream
- ads must be bought in person, gay ads were excluded
- only the parts of the ad describing the person placing it and the person they
  are looking for are included
- the sunday version (which has the most personal ads) was used, 40-60 ads per
  version
- all ads in one edition were sampeled, six editons in a one year period were
  randomly sampeled to try and eliminate bias in seasons etc; sample size was
  sufficient
- then they list all the attribute values that they analyzed, plus length of ad
  and age (if specified)
- if an attribute was mentioned, it was recorded once, otherwise not, then some
  analysis

### Results

- 329 ads were in the six papers, one was gay, so 328 were left
- 65.5% were placed by men, 34.5% were placed by women
- mean age of those placing the ads was 40.4
- women were less likely to specify their age, but both genders were about the
  same in terms of age
- 10 of the 13 variables show a statistically significant sex bias
- biggest differences were attractiveness, professional and financial status
- men were more likely to seek physical attractiveness, women more likely to
  seek professional status, employment, financial status, intelligence,
  commitment, emotion
- women were more likely to look for non-physical attributes
- men were more likely to look for physical attributes

### Discussion

- general stereotypes feminine were desired by men, except emotion in women
- women desired masculine traits, except women looked for emotion in men, so
  a reverse
- Davis finds that stereotypes are still in full effect

### Methodological Issues

- newspaper analysis is less intrusive, but they lack the control of a more
  organized research approach
- ages were similar, so the sample might be somewhat ok
- people placing ads are maybe not representative of the general population
- mean age is 40, is a bit old
