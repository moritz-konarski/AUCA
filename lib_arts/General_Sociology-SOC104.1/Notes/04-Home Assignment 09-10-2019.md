# Suspended Identity

- prison sentences are a massive assault on the inmates identities
- thus we expect radical changes to happen
- the awareness of the prisoners is a kind of defense against this
- this study looks at first-time, short-term inmates
- ten months of participant observation in a maximum security prison for men
- about 50 daily contacts, some more personal ones, some for one-time
  interviews
- How do first-time, short-term inmates define the prison world?
- How do their definitions change over time?
- How do they adapt to the prison world?
- How does this adaptation change over time?
- How do their self-definitions change over time?
- Figure 1: the change of images and strategies
- Preprison Identity
    - inmates had little in common before they came to prison
    - they have no real idea of prison, but know it's different from their
      current social worlds
    - they see inmates as different and dangerous
    - they have fears including: assault, rape, death
    - they also fear that prison will change them
    - thus they prepare a survival strategy: avoid all unnecessary contact,
      defend themselves in any way possible, not to change or be changed
    - self-dialogue and imagining of prison situation in preparation
    - they also review their previous actions
    - this is generally the most thorough self-analysis ever for them
    - this is needed for an identity transformation process
- Self-Insulation
    - the self-dialogue continues for weeks to months
    - now they have some common features in vulnerability, discontinuity,
      differentiation, outsider's perspective on the prison world
    - these conditions are the same for all new, short-term inmates
    - the identity is reduced to emotion for some time
    - greatest conflict is between desire for insulation and for human
      communication
- Managing a Dualistic Self
    - prisoners develop a "prison identity" and an "outside identity"
      distinction
    - the former is seen as false, the latter as true
    - the outside identity is subjective, while the inside identity is
      objective
    - first they decide to "suspend" their preprison identities for the
      duration of the sentence
    - the hope is that they can resume their old identities when they leave
      prison
    - then they need to create an identity that allows them to interact
    - they need to be tough etc. 
    - this is more like identity construction than transformation
    - this identity is like all others: it is learned from, presented to,
      negotiated with and validated by others
    - they believe that they are different, but they cannot show that
      difference
    - in prison, image management is everything: how you walk, look, talk...
    - they give up their unique looks in favor of fitting in to the general
      prisoner look
    - inmates realize that most other inmates do the same stuff as them
    - the prison identity has a shared element, as it is based on other inmates
    - prisoners become more familiar with prison and their identities as their
      sentence progresses
    - there are doubts about their ability to revive their preprison identities
    - the prison identity become the true identity is one of the main fears
- Identity Dialectic
    - at first there is little an inmate can do about his concerns about his
      identity
    - at some point, they will have to deal with this problem
    - they shed their adaptation strategies, change their prison image even
      furhter, reconstruct an image of the outside world, develop and outside
      plan
    - there will be a struggle between the prison and the outside identity
    - the inmate has to come to terms with the actual differences between them
    - they wonder how permanent the changes that happened really are
    - they wonder how much the outside world changed in their absence
    - it is unclear how they will manage on the outside
    - this activity needs to be solitary, as they cannot learn their outside
      identity from other inmates
    - the release identity is a syntheses of the preprison and prison
      identities
- Postprison Identity
    - all identities are different, so one cannot define a specific postprison
      identity
    - visits and interactions with people that use his preprison identity are
      a big help in preserving and strenghthening it 
    - additional support comes from self-reflection during his stay in prison
    - inhibiting things are: continued use of the prison identity, bad
      experiences with visitors, suppression of thoughts about the outside,
      sense of injustice concerning his treatment
    - they also realize that they changed in prison
    - surviving prison made them stronger
    - on the other hand, these tactics can also be used to prevail in the
      outside world
    - __the prison identity has become a part of their self__
