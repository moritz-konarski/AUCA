# The Modern World-System - Immanuel Wallerstein

## Wallerstein himself

- world-system is a social system with boundaries, structures, member groups,
  rules of legitimation, and coherence
- there are conflicting forces from its members, tension holding it together,
  being torn apart by groups seeking to mold the system to their advantage
- it changes in some areas, but is constant in others
- different structures of it can be strong or weak at different points in time
- social system = self-contained, internal dynamic for development
- we can imagine a "social vacuum" and compare different systems to that
- this definition only really includes small autonomous subsistence communities
  or world-systems
- their self-containment is based on extensive division of labor and they
  contain many different cultures
- a world-system that is not governed by one force is called a world-economy
- the modern world-system has survived for 600 years, a big strength
- it has also not turned into an empire yet, which is peculiar
- capitalism is responsible for this thing, and it flourished precisely because
  of it
- this is not a case of state non-interference, quite the contrary, as the
  state always has to absorb economic losses, while the gains mostly go to
  private entities
- capitalism works in an arena that is large enough that no single entity
  controls it
- this gives them freedom to maneuver, enabling constant expansion
- only alternative would be reintegration of production and politics,
  a socialist world government, but this has never existed
- world economy boundaries are fluid, as the means of transmitting information
  always change; Europe resisted becoming an empire for reasons that are not
  mentioned here
- the division of labor within the world-system is not only occupational, but
  geographical, i.e. economic tasks are not evenly distributed, governed by the
  social organization of work, which groups can exploit which other groups
- culture is linked to location, as location (state) is the first level of
  political pressure, and cultural homogeneity is often desired
- advantages areas of WE integration of state and culture both protects and
  justifies the global disparities
- advantaged areas: core-states; in contrast to peripheral areas, with weak or
  non-existent states; moreover there are semiperipheral areas, which are
  somewhere in between
- SPA deflect political pressure away from the core-states, but are at the same
  time excluded from the 

## Someones' Summary

- macroscopical perspective that seeks to explain the dynamics of the
  "capitalist world economy" as a "total social system"
- Immanuel Wallerstein studied in NY, did research in Africa, as exposed to
  radical thoughts in Paris
- he wanted to explain how capitalism works on a global scale and how it
  developed and go against established theories while he was at it
- world-system theory is based on three major blocks: Annales school, Marx, and
  dependence theory
- Annales contributed the historical approach, insistance on the long term,
  focus on geo-ecological regions
- Marx: reality of social conflict among material based groups of humans,
  relevant totality, transitory nature of social forms, class struggles,
  dialectical sense of motion through conflict and contradiction
- dependency theory: neo-Marxist explanation of development processes, wants to
  understand the periphery (like Latin America); origin on many current global
  capitalism critiques
- world-economy: world-system that is integrated through the market rather than
  through a political center, has regions that depend on each other for
  products, there is competition for domination, without it being achieved
- core and periphery regions: capital and labor intensive work, is a structural
  relationship; semi-peripheral regions are a buffer between them, have
  features of both of them
- core (wealthy) exploit and dominate peripheral (poor), have more power
- development is strongly correlated to dominance; dev of poor countries is
  reproducing their status, not improving it
- this disparity is integral to the whole system, enforces flow of surplus to
  the core -> _unequal exchange_ -> _capital accumulation_ at a global scale
- nation states are variables in the system, are used by class forces to pursue
  their interests (core countries)
- _Imperialism_: domination of weak peripheral regions by strong core countries
- _Hegemony_: one core state temporarily outstripping the rest
- hegemonic powers do what is best for them, but change usually gets them in
  time
- there is global _class struggle_
- today we have cyclical rhythms, basis for periodization of history
- Wallenstein envision a change to a socialist world-system, the only
  alternative that could maintain productivity and change the distribution
- W is most popular in the third world, as he contributes to one theory on the
  interactions between first and third world

## Another Summary

### Medieval prelude

- capitalism followed the crisis of the feudal system and explains the rise of
  Western Europe to world domination between 1450 and 1670
- W claims his theory enables sound comparisons between different parts of the
  world
- the feudal system confined populations and commerce
- from 1300-1450 this stopped growth and caused a crisis
- this may have been precipitated by: stagnant agricultural production ->
  higher burden on peasants with growing ruling class; the economic cycle came
  to its end, so the economy began to shrink; climate changes decreased
  agricultural productivity, increased epidemics

### New Division of Labor

- Europe moved towards capitalism to ensure continued economic growth
- thus they had to expand the size of the world that was part of the system,
  different labor control, strong state machineries
- new world economy soon contained a lot of the world, superseding national
  boundaries, it was different from earlier empires as it was not a single
  political unit
- this system in based upon an international division of labor; it determines
  the relationships with other regions and its labor conditions
- political systems are also directly related to a regions placement in the
  world economy
- _The Core_
    - it benefits most from the world-economy
    - developed strong central governments, bureaucracies, mercenary armies
    - local bourgeoisie could obtain control over international commerce and
      extract a surpulus 
    - landless, poor wage-earners provided labor force for manufacturing
    - peasants were displaced by rent, creating new cheap laborers
    - farm technology and pastoralism improved as a result
- _The Periphery_
    - lack strong central governments, or were puppets/colonies
    - exported materials to the core, coercive labor practices
    - large-scale expropriation of surplus from P to C
    - e.g. Poland as grain producer of Europe or Latin America under the
      Spanish and Portugese
    - these were new practices, as they did not produce for internal
      consumption, but for the capitalist world-economy
    - the local aristocracy became strong and rich and had the colonial power
      backing them
- _The Semi-Periphery_
    - C in decline or P rising up
    - served as buffers between C and P
    - had tension between central government and local aristocrats
    - examples are Portugal and Spain
    - SP were also exploited by C, and in turn exploited P; like Spain
      exploiting gold in LA, then paying France and England for goods
- _External Areas_
    - had their own economic systems and remained outside of the modern WE
    - Russia is a good example: supplied its own market above all, traded with
      Asia and with Europe, internal commerce was more important than external
      commerce, strong state kept economy organized and foreign influence at
      bay
### Stages of Growth

- W found 4 stages in the development of the WE
- _Stages 1 and 2_
    - after the rise of the modern world-system 1450-1670
    - all European states attempted to strengthen their positions by:
        - Bureaucratization: aid the power of the king, collect taxes,
          increase state power, expand bureaucracy -> monarch has supreme
          power = absolute monarchy
        - Homogenization of the local population: minorities were expelled to show
          state involvement, create indigenous capitalists, independent groups
          were viewed as threats to a strong state, Jews and Protestants had
          problems with this, the Catholic Church felt threatened
        - expansion of the militia that supports the monarchy
        - absolutism introduces to stress the independence of the monarch from
          laws and everything else
        - Diversification of economic activities to strengthen the local
          bourgeoisie 
    - falling wages made large accumulations of capital possible
    - trade with America and the East had insane profit margins, making the
      rich even richer
    - the ability to buy resources and control the price of the product enables
      merchants to accumulate huge sums of money, which was needed for the
      industrialization of Europe
- _Stages 3 and 4 (18th century ++)_
    - industrial capitalism replaced agricultural capitalism in this period
        - active exploration for new markets to exploit
        - competing world-systems like the Indian Ocean were absorbed into the
          European WS, central America entered the peripheral region
        - new peripheral zones in Africa and Asia further increased surplus
        - C shifts away from agriculture towards pure manufacturing
        - in the 1900s C encouraged shift of P to production so they could sell
          machines
### Theoretical Reprise

- C enriched itself at the expense of P
- this development is detrimental to a large part of the world's population
- disparity increased and there was no prosperity for all
