# Culture

- good definition p.20
- source from which we create most of what we experience as reality,
  enormously important
- material and non-material, but mostly ideas
- depends on symbols to attach meaning to experience and perception
- symbol: something that goes beyond a physical description, that has meaning
  attached to it - anything that represents more than itself
- symbolic objects: state flags, money
- symbolic characteristics of objects: purple as a color of royalty
- symbolic gestures/actions: wink, salutes, the kyrgyz face thing
- spoken and written words, i.e. language: __most important set of symbols of
  any culture__
- symbols are what they mean, they are more than they appear to be

-----

- symbols tell you how to interpret things in certain social situations
- we respond to symbols by what they represent
- symbols are real to, and what we say is real has real consequences for us
- symbols are created, so there is nothing inherent about them
- culture provides a framework of symbols and ideas that we use to interpret
  what we perceive, it is required to fully understand something
- __no culture without language__: collection of symbols (words) and rules for
  their use that we use to communicate
- all languages have sets of symbols (words) and rules on how to use them
  (syntax and grammar)

------

- some words have set meanings, most depend on the context they are used in
- meanings of words are related to how the users perceive their world
- syntax is hugely important, as well as situation, "I love you" can have very
  different implications in different situations

------

- language is the foundation of culture
- language represents reality, allows us to assume that others will know what
  we mean when we write or talk, allows segregation from outsiders, group
  solidarity and boundaries; performative language: saying it is an action (I
  quit, You are under arrest...) a cultural authority to change relationships;
  we can participate in it without much effort
- beliefs: symbolic statements about what is real, judged by culture/society
  outside of the individuals grasp; money will be accepted when you go to the
  store

----

- material culture: productive life is an important aspect of who we are,
  outside of the satisfaction of needs
- it also reflects the values of the culture that produce it: productivity in
  industrial tech is not only for possesion, but also for value of profit
- mc is also a way for a culture to affect its environment: technology for
  example or medicine
- computer tech raises new problems for privacy and the like, e.g. there were
  no laws against hacking when it first happened, still today many cases are
  based on laws written for letters and not for email

----

- culture can also be actively produced and affect social life
- if we say that culture is produced, we can ask about its emergence and how it
  reflects social circumstances
- culture is always being created, shaped and reproduced

# Theoretical Perspectives

## Functionalism

- how social system operate
- what is the use of a certain element of this system
- how they change and remain stable
- how consequences are produced
- how these interfere with the whole
- functional: contributes to the system; dysfunctional: interferes with the
  system
- manifest consequences: intended by someone or something; latent: unintended
  consequences

## Conflict Perspective

- how do social systems promote inequality, division, struggle
- how are consequences of a social system distributed unevenly
- how is stuff used to control certain groups
- heavily indebted to Marx and his ideas about class struggle
- struggle and conflict can be built into the organization of social systems

## Interactionist Perspective

- people's actual experience and behavior in everyday life; how the perceive,
  interpret and feel about things
- is more concerned with small-scale interactions than with whole systems or
  classes of people
- Symbolic interactionism: how symbols are important for the interactions that
  individuals have
- which values, beliefs and attitudes apply to us in a certain situation
- we play different roles in different situations
