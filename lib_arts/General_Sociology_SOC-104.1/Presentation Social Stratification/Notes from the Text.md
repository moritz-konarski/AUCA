# The Uses of Global Poverty: How Economic Inequality Benefits the West

## Introduction

- the authors argue that global poverty benefits the rich nations of the world
- people are aware of the huge wealth disparity between countries
- most people also recognize that this disparity is negative, as wealth
  influences education, health care, consumption
- Why that is the case is not so clearly agreed upon
- the authors use GNI PPP as a comparison factor between countries' wealth
- the global system is characterized by massive maldistribution of wealth,
  economic security, purchasing power -> __fundamental stratification__
- how have the wealthy states responded to this stratification?
- rhetoric has focused on spreading wealth from the west to the rest of the
  world
- G. Bush advocated for this in 1989, connecting it to the spread of western
  values and institutions
- authors say that, except for minute progress, we did not achieve this goal
  yet, mostly stuff is as it used to be
- the rhetoric has not changed either, B. Clinton has said basically the same
  thing as Bush
- the new Bush has not yet done this, but they guess he will
- this rhetoric seems to suggest a focus on extending the wealth to the 1.3
  billion who live on less that $1 a day plus all those just above that
- how can we explain this disparity? Why does it exist?

## Lit review, background

- this article is based on a 1971 article by H. Gans "The Uses of Poverty: The
  Poor Pay All"
- he used a conservative theoretical perspective in sociology, functionalism,
  to inquire about inequality in America
- functionalism: all elements of society have some function in a society, i.e.
  they contribute something to it
- if they would not contribute something to society, they would disappear (from
  the functionalist perspective)
- functions can be manifest (obvious) or latent (hidden)
- assumption is that stuff exists because it has some function -> What is that
  function?
- following, Gans asked: What are the uses of poverty?
- poverty being functional to society as a whole is kinda ludicrous, as it's
  not functional to those experiencing it
- so there must be a smaller part, interest groups and other aggregates existing in a social system, who benefit from poverty
- Gans suspected that few phenomena are functional for society as a whole, most
  only for certain groups, while costing others
- so he looked at poverty from the perspective of how it benefits the nonpoor
  (anyone from the nonpoor classes, not just obvious exploiters)
- he found 13 "uses" of poverty, e.g. there will be someone to do the dirty
  work, someone to purchase goods no one with a choice would, they make good
  scapegoats to uphold the social norms
- he argued that the poor have positive social functions for the nonpoor
- thus, eliminating poverty would actually cost the nonpoor

## The authors' approach

- the same question Gans asked about the US might be asked about the world at
  large
- What are the uses of global poverty for the better-off countries
- this is supposed to create a deeper understanding of why is continues to
  exist
- this is done by explaining how it benefits the inhabitants of well-off states
- they are not arguing that wealthy states are conspiring to keep poor states
  poor, why would they engage in foreign aid otherwise?
- but it might not be in their best interest to develop all states politically
  and economically, which might explain why many programs are aimed at
  survival, not necessarily at prosperity
- this article notes 11 "uses", which are not uses for the global community as
  a whole, but there may be some use for wealthy states
- this might be a good question to ask to better understand global poverty and
  the global "class" system

## The 11 "uses" of global poverty

The existence of global poverty:

1. helps ensure the wealth of affordable goods for Western consumers
    - affordable goods in the West are underpinned by low-wage work in
      low-income contries
    - "Made in China" etc.
    - probably decent quality, reasonable price
    - this is supported by manufacturing moving to poor states which offers
      pools of workers that are needy enought to work for change
    - the cheap wages benefit the western consumer, the workers earn less than
      needed for basic things
    - another element are cheap agricultural laborers (e.g. Latinos in
      California)
    - the knowledge of these problems in the West has only had marginal impact,
      the outrage if prices for food or sneakes rose by 50% to 500% would be
      immeasurably higher
2. benefits the Western companies and shareholders in the form of increased
   profit margins
    - labor cost tends to be a big part of a companies spending
    - reducing labor cost reduces the price for the consumer and also allows
      profit margins to increase
    - thus companies leaving areas with high labor cost is hardly surprising
    - poor female workers in the third world are especially affected by this
    - they make up 80% of workers in export processing zones and are regularly
      paid 20% to 50% less than their male counterparts
    - the less the workers cost, the more profit is made
    - additionally, in those places, the health and safety regulations tend to
      be less strict, further increasing profit
    - companies directly benefit from poor workers that are not in a position
      to not work shitty jobs
3. fosters access to resources that are needed in or desired by the West
    - poor states may sell resources at low prices to Western states who them
      transform them into much more valueable commodities
    - the position of the poor states makes it less likely that they will be
      able to derive the full benefit of their resources
    - Nigeria is an example: a lot of oil, foreign companies mine it, the
      profit largely go to foreigners
4. helps support Western medical advances
    - poor people may be used as lab rats for medication which will later be
      used in the West
    - the highest consumption of medication is definitely in the West
    - in Nigeria, an unapproved drug was tested on children with meningitis
    - there is little regulatory oversight, some doctors feel obliged to
      participate, few alternatives, the companies desire to quickly get the
      drug unto the market, all made this possible
    - sick were test subjects and not patients
    - this does speed up the process, but generally not to the benefit of the
      poor test subjects
5. contributes to the advancement of Western economies and societies with the
   human capital of poor states
    - brain drain and intellectual feeding of rich nations on poor nations
    - rich states take advantage of this, with large quantities of visas and
      stuff
    - still, those foreign workers are paid less than local equivalents would
      be
6. may contribute to the pacification of the Western proletariat
    - class divisions can be obscured by the availability of good, inexpensive
      goods
    - these goods are available for this cheap because of cheap labor in poor
      countries
    - consumption is the great equalizer
    - note: the working class is itself hit by globalist poverty, through
      industry leaving etc
7. poor countries make optimal dumping grounds for goods that are dangerous,
   expired or illegal
    - you need some place to store e.g. nuclear waste, so it's going to be
      a poor country
    - e.g. Russia allowing the import of foreign nuclear waste to bring in
      money
    - another example is Alang in India, where large ships are dismantled,
      a very dangerous and environmentally destructive process
8. provides jobs for specialists to assist, advise, and study the world's poor
   and to protect the "better off" from them
    - development workers, operation through aid organizations
    - academics write about and decipher the lives of the poor
    - journalists can make careers out of showing how the poor live
    - border patrol etc are tasked with keeping the poor out
9. benefits the inhabitants of wealthy countries, who can feel good about
   helping the global poor through charitable work and charitable giving
    - people feel good about sharing their fortune
    - example World Vision, where people sponsor children after seeing stuff on
      TV
    - this counters all the consuming that we do, even though it really does
      not
    - it makes people feel better, as they are helping
    - the contrast of seeing people being poor also makes us feel better about
      ourselves, regadless of how well off we are in relation to our own
      economy
10. makes possible the massive flow of resources westward
    - most of the worlds resources flow towards the west, as the consumption
      there is just so much higher
    - the west benefits from the fact that few other places can afford to
      consume at such high levels as them
11. enables the scapegoating of poor countries with (generally) higher
    reproduction rates
    - is overpopulation the bigger problem or massive consumption of
      a minority?
    - people use this so they don't have to blame people that are not
      themselves
    - the poor provide distraction from the problem the West is causing
 
## Conclusion

- this argument highlights that the global stratification will not end as long
  as it is beneficial to the West
- it is surely the case that poverty does not have to exist
- while we benefit from this, the effort will remain relatively low and target
  survival, not prosperity
- "Phenomena like poverty can be eliminated only when they become dysfunctional
  for the affluent or powerful, or when the powerless can obtain enough power
  to change society" - Gans

# To investigate

- did the lip-service continue?
- how did the GNI PPP develop? Compare the growth
- how many people live in absolute poverty? more than 1.3 bio probably
- how does Gans's view fit into functionalism?
- who hurt the author?
- it's not surprising that this was never published outside of this book
- no correct citations
- the argument does not consider any other effects, it is very one-dimensional
- this text is a very close rip of the original text
- most of these points can be connected to others, and thus reduced in number
- Gans' text is pretty neutral as far as language is concerned, much in
  contrast to this one
- he also suggests functional altenatives, which is what I would expect and
  academic to do, especially if they were really negative for the whole text
- it is exactly the same essay as the original one, just missing the important
  alternatives and their analysis
