# Structure of the presentation

1. Title page, Text title and author, my name
2. Social stratification - Definition - Question for the class - Animation
    - Social stratification is structured inequality between groups
3. How can this apply to countries globally?
    - there are wealthy countries and poor countries: Can you give examples?
4. Overview of GNI PPP, and other basics of the paper
    - 1999: US, Germany, Australia, China, Indonesia, Pakistan, Nigeria, Sierra
      Leone -> how does this look today and overall trend
    - make some graphs
5. The approach of the authors vs. the original paper on the US
    - basically the same thing, uses the same structure and almost the same
      amount of points
    - missing the important bit of offering alternatives/at least considering
      them
6. Summary of the main points
    - resources: 3., 5., 7., 10.
    - ensure wealth/prosperity: 1., 2., 4., 8.
    - stable society: 6., 9., 11.
    - give analogous points from Gans article
    - __include the authors conclusion__, ask what the class thinks about them
    - what do you think of these points - do they make sense to you?
7. Specific example of one of these things or one for each section
    - 
8. Critique of the paper
    - it's pretty biased in it's formulation
    - the 11 sections can more or less be put into 3 main ideas
    - I feel like it lacks depth
    - it seems superficial
    - it is super close to Gans's paper, it even cites his conclusion
    - GNI PPP per capita without mentioning it, no consideration of development
      over time
