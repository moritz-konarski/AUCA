# Semetey pp. 340-357

## Notes

- S is empty headed, he becomes the leader of the 40 Companions of Manas
- he goes through the same kind of growing up as Manas and other heroes
- towards autumn, he wants to go raiding, asks if the others have seen
  different places
- he has a white and blue yurt, 60 mares as provisions
- the companions feel reminded of Manas
- companions are pushing 70
- among themselves they are critical of S: he is rascally, never flees, has
  black blood and blue lice; his neck-breaking attitude will kill us, they want
  to go out wearing their funeral clothes
- the companions set out without S, and a week later he finds out
- S sets out to pursue them, riding hard
- he asks them if they lost their appetite for material things, he recounts
  some of their great exploits
- he gives them a gift of honor, his racer that took him there
- the companions just ride by them
- he shouts at them to halt, telling them he will follow them anyways
- S makes gestures of submission, but even that is ignored
- S goes into rage, bawls some war cries and lowers his lance
- S slaughters the companions and their horses, return home, where two of the
  companions wives are pregnant
- they both give birth when he dismounts, one holds a flower, the other gore
- S laments how lonely he is, nothing works out, this section is in a totally
  different style of English
- S makes a great feast, takes the two kids as milk-brothers, making Kanikey
  nurture them
- S himself gives the boys the names, letting himself be a next of kin
- the two of them became great warriors
- those two companions stood beside S at all times
- S is addressed as 'Dear Wretch', he seems worried
- Ay-curok, Akin's daughter, is apparently a good seamstress, she has second
  sights, she can bring dead souls back to life
- she is already promised to Kokco's son Umutoy, so S will go to Akin with his
  companions and ask for her hand or take it by force
- the next day they ride out, arriving at Akin's at dawn
- S sends his companions out to go and get Ay-curok and put in a good word for
  him; she is described as being at festivities, winning fights with men
- she is swayed by the nice words, she gets onto S's horse and he rides off
  with her
- they drove some horses together and Kan-coro will go steal some horses, they
  want to hold a feast
- the more stupid one tried to drive the herd home, then he played dead
- Umutoy came with an army to get his bride back, he takes all the horses
  except for S's
- Kul-coro gets back to the camp and finds it deserted, no horses left etc
- Kul-coro gets cursed by the other one for being a coward
- Kan-coro does not know how he may look at Semetey after what happened
