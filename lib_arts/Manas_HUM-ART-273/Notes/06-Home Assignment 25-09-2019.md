# Notes on the Fight between Manas and Kokco pp. 77-85

## Notes

- Manas made a name for himself, he struck fear into the hearts of his enemies
- 'the White Padisha' is one that Manas listens to, a great warrior himself
- Manas has done great deeds, destroyed fortresses and stoled maidens
- 'the gibbering Manchu' are afraid of Manas, he rules the clouds
- M rules everything, Manas and the White Padisha are equal? even though M is
  his subject?
- Manas did not come to fight the Russians, he rounded up his herd (no
  Russians)
- all people, except Russians, submitted to Manas
- Manas won against Joloy, Konur-bay, the Sart people, Galcha people, Kizil-bas
- M did give gifts to the White Padisha, the Czar of Russia
- he has great companions, all great heroes, who were very loyal to him
- Manas does not trot on his race horse, he gallops
- even the moon fears Manas, the sun dreads him and hides
- Ak-kula is the fastest horse, Ak-kubo is the best armor
- Manas is the ultimate fighter
- again the repetition of formulas: description of armor and horse
- Manas chooses Er Kokco as his next target, to steal his livestock
- he will ravage Kokco's possessions and kill his men single handedly
- taking his horse as a workhorse and taking his armor are also on the menu
- Manas shall make Kokco's horse a gift to the Czar
- "In summer there is great refulgence" - there is brilliance/radiance/shiny
  stuff in summer???
- the Czar counseled Manas?
- the czar lies in wait for the mountain ram, young or old, he is loftier than
  Ala-too
- under the protection of the White Padisha Manas will not be attacked by
  anyone
- Manas seized many herds and animals from his rivals, to his subjects rejoice
- repeated threat to steal Kokco's herds, maidens and armor, and he will cut down all
  heroes that try to oppose him
- when Kokco comes to take it back, I'll wait for him
- he did come, and asks for the herds to be split equally, M may keep some of
  the stuff for himself, "take them at your barrier"
- Manas tells him that one of them shall die, as he disagrees with his offer
- if you can't win, you deserve nothing
- K will give him his oddly specifically described gun to shoot him at point
  blank range, if he survives, he will take the herds
- Manas is not afraid, he takes up the challenge
- they start wrestling, K wants M to let go of his collar
- he implores M to stop, as he already raided him, without provocation, they
  will lose their good name if they die over cattle
- he hands M his gun, same phrase repeated as above, Kokco dodges the bullet
- now it's Kokco's turn to shoot and he hopes Manas does not die
- he hits Manas' heart and almost kills him
- K regrets it and vows to restore him to life using pills that can reanimate
  the dead, otherwise Manas would be useless dead
- M goes on a far journey, a metaphorical one that is
- Manas was with God, his friend and with the Czar
- Manas used to think that he was god, but isn't god different
- he calls to all of his companions as he does not know the way
- K pulls M down from his horse, M tries to kill him but kills K's horse
- M can't kill K without committing a sin in the eyes of Allah
- he tells him that the horse should be enough food for 4 days???, make boots
  out of the hide of the horse

## Observations

- Manas was very famous, made a name for himself
- he was in company of the Czar of Russia, who he subjected himself to
- everyone (EXCEPT RUSSIANS) submitted to Manas
- is M a Russian subject, also why all this bootlicking? because the Russians
  rule the tribe now? because they think Radloff is Russian?
- Manas is epic and awesome, we get it
- Manas gave gifts to the Czar and received counsel, so he met the Czar/an
  envoy?? He must be really important then
- the Czar gives strange, cryptic advice, __and protects Manas?__
- lots of repeated formulas
- Kokco tries to take back what Manas stole and they duel because Manas is
  a hothead, Kokco does not want a duel, cattle is not worth dying over
- Manas misses his shot, Kokco does not and injures Manas
- Manas goes on a long journey (metaphorical) where he finds God (Allah)
- K does not want to kill Manas, sees it as a waste, maybe scared of the
  companions or the Czar
- M does not kill Kokco as that would be a sin in the eyes of Allah, suddenly
- Kokco can apparently eat a whole horse in 4 days
