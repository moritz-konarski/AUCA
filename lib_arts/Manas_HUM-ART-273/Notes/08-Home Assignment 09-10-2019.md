The Birth of Manas
==================

Notes
-----

-   Radloff thought the poem was for him specifically
-   in Tokmak in 1869
-   normally, Manas is in the Talas valley, here he is from the Almaty
    rivers
-   the location is possibly a gesture against the Russians, who would
    have lived beneath Jakip (on the flat land) in this story
-   Jakip is unusually resolute in this text, normally not so much
-   Manas mother is the daughter of Aydar-khan here, generally not
    explicit
-   Jakip is courageous, son of a couple khans, his location is
    described
-   he married his wife Ciyrici, but never fathered a child
-   she never: unbraided her hair, looked at him lovingly, bound her
    waist tightly, born a male child
-   in 14 years, she never went to holy tombs, slept near heath-giving
    springs
-   he wants God to help him have a child
-   of only her waist were to be bound tight, he could have a child
-   the son would shatter and raid the: Noygut, Kokanders, Sart, Kazakh,
    Kirghiz
-   Jakip wore a bow and arrows around his waist and made a child
-   this child was super white and well-shaped
-   he slaughtered a white mare in celebration
-   then Manas was surveyed by four prophets, who called him Manas
-   envoys from Yarkend, China, Nogoy came, ate in the feast and then
    declared that Manas would be their ruin
-   Manas had a nice crib, all the peoples heard about him and his
    future might
-   the baby boy Manas speaks: he shall open up the path for the muslims
    and fight the infidels, Muslims will be victorious
-   Jakip dons his armor and orders Bakay-khan to him
-   Manas wants to scatter the treasure of the Kalmak
-   Manas also wants to go on a long journey
-   Jakip asks Bakay to guide Manas, show him stuff he has never seen,
    teach him
-   Bakay knew the land where **Adam and Eve** were born
-   Bakay should find him a horse, cloak when he is ready
-   he will have a giant Koran and Book; show him the right path!
-   be the friend and guide, Bakay, even in the afterlife
-   Bakay vows to do what Jakip asks and suggests some good raiding
-   at 10 Manas shot bows, at 14 he smashed khan's yurts and became one
    himself
-   he raided Bukhara and Kokand, he fought different Chinese tribes

Observations
------------

-   they had some strange ideas about how conception worked
-   Manas is of course a badass baby
-   he has a mentor that will teach him what he needs to know
-   the naming of Manas is pretty prophetic
-   Adam and Eve appear in this story for some reason
-   Manas grows up really fast
-   the (un)tying of braids is supposed to help women in labor, good
    biology
-   there is also a ritual of binding the waste of pregnant women in
    childbirth
-   touring tombs and being near apple trees is supposed to "cure"
    infertility
-   apples are also supposed to fix that
