# Maldibay Borzu uulu

## Notes

- _SMB_
- Kirghiz
- not published 
- 1899
- two _Semetey_ poems
- monument of Kirghiz literature
- one of the oldest concerns of native Kirghiz (p. 195)
- first mix of oral bards and mullas doing stuff for turkic-speaking
  consumption
- MBU wasn't the original author and there were two of them
- MBU transcribed the text instead of transcribing it
- he probably wasn't an accomplished oral poet
- the two poems show differences in orthography, epithets and the like -> two
  different bards/poets
- a bard would not have let the differences in the text slide
- the fact that he did marks him as a literati or connoisseur
- the handwriting does confirm that MBU copied both of them though
- here we have the problem that it is completely uncertain how many
  copies/iterations the texts MBU copied went through before he did
- thus it is a work of literature, not directly oral epic poetry, even though
  it embodies it
- the structure of the text fits more into the twilight age than the old age
- shows a bridging of when the story was more than a short part of the epics
  but not yet the fully fleshed-out version of later bards
- the flashbacks that put _Manas_ material into _Semetey_ were a twilight-age
  invention
- I,6) and _SMB(1)_ are largely similar in content, but not in form
- __differences__: Kanikey condones and blesses _Semetey_ and Manas' _arbak_
  settles upon _Semetey_ when he performs rituals at Manas' tomb
- the talking horse outside of something like a lament is rare and probably to
  fill a gap in the plot -- a break with earlier tradition and new era of less
  strict rules
- there are almost 40 companions, which would be crazy for an oral poet, but
  written down it is not totally surprising
- itineraries are absent from this text
- the descriptions of landscapes now begins to be more lyrical and longer than
before, a twilight age thing
- there is a remnant of older texts at the end where Kanikey tells Semetey to
eat after killing the men, the motive may be them not giving Manas a funeral
feast -- revenge is more than just getting rid of rivals
- extinguishing Semetey's fire is probably an old saying that lost its meaning
-- used to mean kill of his line -- now it's just a normal description
- earlier Semetey lured Ay-curok out of her betrothal, later they have been
promised each other since before birth 
- the structure of the love story is pretty similar to modern stories
- Semetey has less agency in this poem than in the previous ones
- Semetey recognizes the people but does not say it, the reasons here are not
clear -- riding in full armor can make the opening exchange more interesting

## Text

- written in black ink on a piece of yellowed pulp paper
- damaged
- notes and page numbers added after the fact
- 6000 lines of text in mostly 3 columns
- one leaf is missing, the western and persian numbers do not agree
- Kirghiz language, post-Chaghatay script
- the used letter fluctuate -- maybe written down like one would speak it and
not spell it
- epithets and diction indicate that the two parts of the story are from two
different authors

# Tinibek Japiy uulu

## Notes

- STJ
- 1898
- ordered by police chief in Narin to perform
- not clear if Tinibek was literate or not
- it is shorter than SMB, but has a lot of detail
- the story is mostly the same
- Semetey's crossing of the river is cause for amusement for the ladies, not
the same as in SMB
- the union takes place in Akun Khan's city, where AC rebukes Semetey and tells
him to go back to his wife, where the story ends in a cliffhanger
- this was due to Arabayev wanting to publish the full story later, but that
never happened
- the characters need to make their status clear and thus brag about it
- Semetey is clumsy compared to his companion when crossing the river, the
companion has all the nice gear and shit
- this is more of a mock-epic where the hero is laughed at than a traditional
epic
- STJ is a lot less serious than SMB, where people act more respectful
- some curses are not as striking as normal, as they are not spoken by seers,
but by normal people
- Tinibek was master in the traditional dilation and decoration -- he takes
full advantage of all the things when he describes them
- there are some flashbacks in here as well, like the newer periods have 
- the itineraries are less realistic than the 19th century ones, there is less
actual geography involved
- the chaos that is Kanikey's flight path flies in the face of 19th century
itineraries -- it just does not make sense
- religious cultivation is more apparent is this epic than in the ones before
it
- there are term used now that were unheard of in the earlier periods
- Manas is still a strong spirit here, invoking his name really gets things
going
- the use of these _arbak_ are all too common in this period
