# Notes

- Begaim Usenova, media literacy expert from a Kyrgyz NGO
- they protect freedom of expression in KG, in courts, etc

## Introductory photo

- we look at a photo: fire, people filming, some kind of guard, a building (not
  definite)
- photo shows two people being lynched in Mexico because of fake news, two guys
  that were arrested for unrelated crimes were accused of being kidnappers and
  organ harvesters
- the crowd pushed into the police station and set the two on fire
- it was also live streamed on Facebook
- there is an investigation underway regarding the crime

## Why do we share this stuff? 

- it resonates with people
- they want to be informed
- they care and want others to be safe
- emotions resonate with people
- also crowds tend to go wild, when one person alone would never even think of
  something like this
- this stuff pollutes the digital environment

## What's the problem?

- overwhelming amount of information
- Facebook, WA and all those other social networks
- ~2 bn. websites, hundreds of thousands of photos and videos consumed each
  minute
- __zoning information__: sorting through information
- only a small part of information is verified, and even if it is, that does
  only mean so much
- 1999-2004: information came from book, magazines, TV, radio -> there was some
  gate keeping, some checking of information by some people, and one could find
  out who it was
- today everyone can share information with everyone else; the scale of the
  sharing was wildly different

## How do we know which information to trust?

- some videos are for entertainment (even thought they are interviews), some
  are ads
- some stuff is made for persuasion 
- some stuff is meant to provoke, even though it might not be lynchings
- provocations might try to use false or distorted information

## News and Journalism

- they ask questions to find out information without a bias, at least that
  would be ideal
- news: something new based on facts, reliable, neutral
- raw information is just documentation of stuff

## Media literacy

- critical approach
- access to media and content
- ability to decipher media 
- awareness of how media works
- ask questions about the messages we receive
- distinguish between the different kinds of messages
