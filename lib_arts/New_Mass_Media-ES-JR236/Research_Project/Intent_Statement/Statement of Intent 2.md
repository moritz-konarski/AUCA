# Statement of Intent rev. 2

## Topic: Privacy vs. Security on the internet

Information security is one of the foundations on which the internet is built.
If data on the internet were visible and accessible by anyone, many normal
activities such as writing an email or doing internet banking would be impossible. 
The main technology that allows information to be transmitted
confidentially and securely is encryption.   
Today's encryption technology is
virtually impenetrable.Therefore, law enforcement agencies and governments 
fear that they will "go dark", i.e. be unable to gather enough data to do 
their jobs. They propose to either modify existing encryption technology to 
incorporate "master keys", or to restrict the use of strong encryption to 
make it easier to break.
Both ideas are heavily criticized as such backdoors could be exploited by criminals
or foreign governments. Thus they would weaken the data security for everyone, not 
just criminals.   
The issue is that these two reasonable interests conflict with each other, and 
there seems to be no easy way to resolve this conflict. On one hand,
law enforcement should be able to do its job and stop criminals. On the other
hand, compromising the security and privacy of everyone is a (too) high price to pay.    

I want to look into the current status of this debate in the EU (and maybe the
USA) and investigate whether there are any reasonable solutions to the
conflict.
