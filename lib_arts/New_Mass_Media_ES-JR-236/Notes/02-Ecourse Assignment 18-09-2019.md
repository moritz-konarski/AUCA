# Internet Media

1. Provide 3 real-life examples of internet commercialization:
    1. One very common and very annoying example of commercialization of the
       internet are "newsletters" which companies start sending you after you
       sign up for their service. Nowadays there is generally an option to opt
       out, but it is small and hidden away so people don't click it.
       These "newsletters", which were intended to keep you up to date
       with the service you are using, are often used to just spam the user
       with advertisements for the company's product(s), even though the user
       probably never asked for them. 
       As an example, I created an Adobe account quite some time ago and have
       since been getting a constant stream of ads and notifications about
       products I never expressed interest in.
    2. An different kind of online ads are those that are embedded into regular
       content so they look like they belong there. I guess this system became
       popular because people became pretty good at ignoring the banner ads at
       the top and sides of the webpages and if you do not recognize the ad
       from a mile away you might actually click on it (even if it's an
       accident).  
       For example, my German e-mail provider WEB.DE implants advertisements for
       completely unrelated offers (like insurance) into the list of e-mails on
       my feed. They are even made to look like e-mails, with similar
       formatting of the text. The only thing that marks them as ads is a small
       symbol in the corner and a slightly different background color, both of
       those things are easy to miss when you click through e-mails.
    3. The third type of commercialization I notice on the internet are
       targeted advertisements based on my browsing and online shopping habits.
       Two main examples come to mind when I think about targeted ads. One is
       the recommended page on Amazon, where they show you what other people
       with similar shopping habits bought. Amazon is banking on the fact that
       these recommendations will move you to buy more stuff, thus making them
       more money. Even though I don't like it, I have to admit that their
       recommendations fit the stuff I would think about buying very well (even
       though they have never directly lead me to a purchase).  
       The second example I can think of are targeted pre-roll ads on YouTube,
       which for some time only showed me online learning platforms for
       programming languages because I searched for tutorials more than once.
       These ads are more annoying than anything else, especially if they are
       not skippable and longer than 5 seconds. These ads have never gotten me
       to popusefully click on them.  
       It is interesting to note that I receive significantly fewer ads on
       YouTube etc. when I am in Kyrgyzstan compared to when I am in Germany,
       even though my browsing habits are relatively consistent. I would
       hypothesize that the Kyrgyz market for online advertizing is not as big
       or developed as the one in Germany or that my type of ad-profile is less
       common in Kyrgyzstan and thus not targeted as much.

2. _Think of an example of how social media help bring community problems into
   the spotlight in your country/city._       
   I thought about this prompt for a while and I cannot think of any case where
   that happened in my city or country that I noticed. This is due to me 
   mainly living abroad for the last 2 years and not really following social media in either Germany or Kyrgyzstan. 
   One thing that is happening in Germany, but also all around the world, are
   the Fridays for Future climate protests. These protests were started by
   Greta Thunberg, a Swedish teenager who took time off school to protest
   climate change outside the Swedish parliament in Stockholm. Her protests
   quickly gained popularity and international traction. Greta has also given talks
   in front of the EU Parliament and the 2018 UN Climate Change Conference
   (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greta_Thunberg).  
   The largest protest yet is planned for this Friday, where children and
   teenagers around the world plan to go on a climate strike to show force and
   make their voices heard. The protest takes place 3 days before the UN
   Climate Action Summit in New York City, where the mayor has decided to allow
   students to skip school in order to attend the protests
   (https://nyti.ms/301d92L). The General Secretary of Amnesty International
   has also sent out an open letter to school around the world urging them to
   let students participate in the climate protests
   (https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2019/09/amnesty-chief-urges-schools-to-let-children-take-part-in-climate-strikes/).  
   Social Media played a big role in organizing the protests and coordinating 
   the efforts of thousands of people who fight for a better future. Without
   easily accessible social networks it would be really hard to plan and
   execute protests on a global scale. A couple of decades ago such
   international organization would have been much harder, as the barriers to
   writing a Facebook post that can reach thousands are so much lower than the
   barriers to getting your own radio or TV segment to spread your message. The
   media might still spread the news of the protests, but the way they are
   portrayed would be out of their hands.
