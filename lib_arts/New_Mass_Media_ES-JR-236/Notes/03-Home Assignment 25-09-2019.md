# Notes on Zuckerberg's and Harari's Conversation

- historians do more than just look at the past, the present is important
- one of the big topics is whether tech and progress brings us together or
  tears us apart
- now is more connected than ever before
- connectivity =! harmony; we fight those closest to us the most
- connection can lead to conflict
- rise of connection and then politicians want to build walls
- more connected than ever, more walls being built than ever before
- what we need is more connection, but only if individual's needs are still met
- instead of fragmentation one may say personalization
- connect with groups of people that share your values
- Z played baseball because there were no other peers that he could connect
  with
- the internet allows you to find groups without geographical constraints
- today you can experience this stuff, but you miss out on the stuff you'd
  otherwise done, there might have been a more fragmented society, less
  together
- now we have people that would have been part of the community, but now
  everyone else has moved on and they are left behind
- all progress can not replace actual physical experience, your body is still
  bound
- you cannot excape the real world (like unfriending your neighbors)
- you had to learn how to get along, develop social mechanisms
- online communities take this difficult and important experience away
- physical contact is still important, we are physical beings
- online communities can be starting points for actual social contact
- are we trying to keep people tied to the screens or do we want them to leave
  the screen as soon as possible to go outside
- is it fragmentation or connection?
- FB is optimized for meaningful social interaction
- market research that helps facebook optimize their algorithms
- new cultural norms/some are more united? What do we build on top of that?
- might be a richer set of subcultures, be more creative
- online communities can now form online, is this fragmentation?
- or is it richness in our social life, even if people do different things
- how do you still create enough social cohesion in countries/globally to solve
  problems
- global cooperation is required to solve the problems we have today
- how will jobs be distributed, how will we handle automation, AI singularity
- how do we create a global safety net to not create the most unbalanced
  society in history?
- we need global cooperation to prevent this
- issue one is AI, the second is global cooperation
- global cooperation:
    - spreading human rights, prosperity
    - global framework is already kinda there
    - now we need a local structure that can support what the global can't
    - joining extreme groups is a symptom of poor conditions
    - people feeling good != not being extreme, doing bad shit
    - the bad guys do not see themselves as the bad guys, that often like it
    - dislocation can lead to people joining fringe groups
    - community, opportunity, better life lower the chances of being extremists
    - globalization is very positive????
    - more competition -> lower wages, more competition, 5-10% of people are
      worse off after globalization
    - new very positive, just some disadvantaged????
    - system needs to work at a global level, but also in local communities
    - we've done stuff for some creator, yadayadayada
    - middle US is more important to Facebook than someone in the third world
    - FB is criticized for encouraging people to move to extremes
    - Harari worries most about increasing inequality between different parts
      of the world
    - it undermines democracy, individualism, etc
    - it will continue to be a major problem, even if we solve extremism
    - everyone is supposed to have a sense of purpose, we are social animals
    - now switch topics, never directly answers questions
- artificial intelligence:
    - not because robots will come and kill us
    - even worse when they always obey instead
    - this will increase inequalitiy, few contries lead the AI game
    - after the Industrialization it took 150 years
    - AI will reopen the gap and it will be much worse than before
    - AI and the meaning of human agency
    - can you hack human beings, AI knows you better than you do yourself
    - authority goes from humans to AI's/algorithms
    - what does this do to human agency
    - both have a similar question: who builds it and what values will it have
    - AI is connected to the tech-sector, has a lot of applications outside of
      it
    - connected to data and pricacy questions
    - Z agrees with the questions he is raising
    - countries that can invest in new tech do because it will give great
      economic advantage
    - US has a major advantage, as most big tech companies are from the US
    - american ideas shape facebooks conduct????
    - it gets down to the values that you encode, even though some countries
      have some big advantages
    - a lot of AI is open research, which might enable an entrepreneur
    - he can use the available services from the global economy, hahaha
    - future should be open, unified, not fragmented
    - countries have different policies -> problem
    - if research stays open, it should be fine
    - values are different from countries to countries
    - GDPR-like stuff should be more globally used
    - every country should have some privacy regulations
    - authoritarian models will force companies to provide data for all kinds
      of shit
    - can one store data about India in the US when "America First" is in
      progress???
    - the intent matters, there should be open values
    - it boils down to "do we trust america?", today this is questionable
    - _America was never the leader of the free world_
    - US gave this up, is more self focused now, US is thinking about voting
      against a UN resolution against sexual violence
    - Z switches to GDPR, evades the question
    - once a country gets their own data or else sets the precedent
    - FB pushes back and tries to keep it right
    - they only put datacenters where there is good rule of law
    - I, I, I, I, I as the boss of FB oughhhhh
    - human rights are violated when people are not allowed to speak
    - people running these companies need to push back against stuff that can
      go wrong
    - global, democratic progress is needed to make it work
    - how can we build AI that it's not inherently a tool of surveillance and
      inequality
    - different places are building this tech now, how can is serve individuals
    - how to keep it from becoming the ultimate surveillance tool

# Notes in class

- connectivity: can unity or fragment
- can connect online and then meet up in real life as FB would like it to be
- some people can be left behind, as all others now go online ->
  marginalization
- unity: interest groups, opportunities to get together irl
- fragmentation: marginalization of some groups, giving up on real life, can't
  un-neighbor your neighbor etc.
- cohesion: some might keep dev. for themselves, then the rest is left behind
- equality: can prevent extremism; globalization should benefit everyone, not
  just a few of them
- where should the data be?
- AI: breaches of data privacy; storing data; manipulation
- GDPR as a benchmark of data protection policies
