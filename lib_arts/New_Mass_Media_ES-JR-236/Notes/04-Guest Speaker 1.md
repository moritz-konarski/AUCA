- was press secretary of the Prime Minister
- What social media are you using?
- What are you using social media for?
- What role does social media play in your life?
- TV news are too structured for today
- Data is becoming more important in social media, just as politics is
- Video on GB in the EU
    - they send 20 mio. pounds to the EU
    - then we get a list of stuff that could also be done with the money
    - it's propadanda, through and through
- Video on before the EU in GB
    - visa regs were liften after the EU
    - high tax and high beaurocracy
    - smaller customer base
    - EU made all of this disappear
    - dude thinks is would be catastrophic to give all of this up
- first video is misleading because it neglects the fact that the UK benefits
  from the WU
- second video was not good, didn't reach it's target audience
- social media was the main place of discussion of Brexit, not the standard
  media
- the UK is trying to give feedback and make itself more approacheable
- short attention span means that people need to be captured in the first
  couple seconds or lines, otherwise the audience will be lost
- post truth: not meant for truth, but just for emotion and then to convince
- huge role of twitter in the two local revolutions
- there is a lot of misinformation on social media, e.g. through videos on
  WhatsApp 
- always use at least two sources, some official, some alternative, some that
  contradict your view
- people also try to spin stuff, "yes he embezzled, but he built a school"
- do not trust a single source of news
- lots of examples that kinda go to nothing
- she did not notice any influencing of social media in the Kyrgyz government
- there is a difference between in-person learning and learning over distances
- there is a loss of emotion and stuff when you don't learn in person
