# Structure of Z's proposal

## What do they want to do?

- offer a living room compared to the current town square
- privacy-focused messaging
- follow trends of people wanting fewer permanent records and more intimate
  conversations
- give users the confidence that they have control over who receives their
  messages
- messages and calls are some of the most private things, so they must be
  protected
- unify their services

## How will they do that?

- working together is needed to get this right
- only store data in secure locations

1. Encryption
    - secure communications so that no one else can access them
    - use e2e encryption on all services like on WhatsApp right now
    - this protects from hackers, overreaching governments and service
      providers
    - fewer people with access means fewer chances of a breach
    - e2ee is central to this -- decentralizes as no one can read the messages
    - even if data is at rest, the encrypted form is pretty useless
    - even with all the drawbacks, Z thinks e2ee is the way to go
2. Reduced Permanence 
    - people can be hurt or inconvenienced by old content
    - data should only be stored as long as needed or desired
    - people could set times for data to expire or have it do that
      automatically
    - lots of data is an asset and a liability at the same time
    - meta data too should be stored for shorter periods of time -- it's only
      needed for spam and safety filters
    - collecting less information in the first place

## Issues

- keeping people safe on an encrypted service as best as they can, but that can
  be hard as they cannot read the messages or data
- data needs to be stored in places where it is safe from abuses of the law
- people need to trust the data storage in order to be able to trust the
  service
- is a tradeoff between safety and security
- encryption includes privacy to do bad things: cse, terrorism, extortion
- FB has to work with LEAs to do the best they can
- encryption makes checking more difficult than it even is today
