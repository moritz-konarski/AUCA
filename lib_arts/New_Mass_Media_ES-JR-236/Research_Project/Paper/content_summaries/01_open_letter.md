# Open Letter on "Privay first"

## The Reason

- they are not happy with e2ee on Facebook's services
- it would seriously hinder law enforcement's ability to gather data
- this would in turn make them worse at their job
- it will also cause facebook to be less effective in doing their part of the
  policing
- they think the proposal would pose a risk to user safety as well as public
  safety
- facebook going forward with these proposals should not come at the expense of
  LEA's ability to bring justice to perpetrators

## Calls to Action

1. embed safety of the public in system design to enable fighting illegal stuff
   without reducing safety; enable prosecution of offenders, protection of
   victims
    - don't make is so secure that you cannot police your own network anymore
2. enable LEA to get lawful access to content in a readable and usable format
    - give us access to the data under given circumstances -- can't be
      encrypted -- exceptional access
3. take govs considerations seriously and engage in consultation
    - actually listen to what we have to say
4. don't implement the systems until they are operational and guarantee safety
   for your users
    - make sure that stuff will work and that we are satisfied
