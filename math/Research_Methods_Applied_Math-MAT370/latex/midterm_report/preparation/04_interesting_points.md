# Interesting Points

## How long would a cycle theoretically have to be according to _Garner_

- find this length for a couple of known proven numbers
- explain how the process works

## Heuristic estimation of the height of x and the conjecture in _Crandall_

- compute this for some large numbers and see what happens
- explore this conjecture a bit
