### Original ~66 words

Application of Additional Argument Method to Burgers type equation with an 
integral term on the right-hand side was considered. A scheme of the method 
for the Burgers type equation is constructed. The validness of the scheme 
construction using Computer Algebra System (CAS) Maple was proved. The 
capability of modern CAS to prove mathematical theorems was demonstrated. The 
graphical solution of the series sample equations was constructed.

_What is Burgers' equation/why is it useful?_             
This paper considers an application of the Additional Argument Method to the
Burgers' equation with an integral term on the right-hand side. _What does the
integral term signify?_ The scheme of this method for Burgers' equation is 
constructed and its validity proven using the Computer Algebra System Maple. 
The proof demonstrates the capability of these systems to prove mathematical 
theorems. Furthermore, the graphical solution of the series sample equations 
is constructed. _What does that mean?_
