# Love and the Brain -- Dr. Elena Molchanova

- found some pictures online
    - emotions vs rationality -- heart and brain fight
    - heart and brain work together in harmony
    - hear in the brain -- love is in the brain
    - knotted/distorted brain -- mental disorder?
    - _Donatella Marazziti_ -- focus is too much on neuroscientific problems 
and not joy
- _Helen Fisher_ -- it's a new idea to accept that the brain is associated 
with love in the first place
    - http://www.helenfisher.com/books.html
    - great TED talker
    - special brain systems for love
- love can be like or lead to
    - a drug addiction: craving, tolerance, withdrawal
    - kinda like OCD
    - poor judgement and distorted reality
- even if you walk into a room of people with identical backgrounds, you'll 
still be in love with probably one of them
- ___romantic love is a mental disorder!?___
- love is a motivation like thirst and hunger
- one of the oldest parts of the brain is the _reptillian brain_ which is 
responsible for rewards, hunger etc
- Pavlov's pyramid of needs does not put love in the basic necessities, but in 
terms of the brain it is a primary need 

craving from a biological pov:

- dopamine is responsible for or us feeling rewards
- dopamine is released when you are close to getting a reward
- majority of dopamine release is actually higher when you miss your loved 
ones, not when you have them
- VTA/Hippocampus area is where the problems come from
- _Nucleus accumbens_ releases dopamine when someone takes cocaine for example, 
also triggered by medication
- both _Nucleus accumbens_ and _Hippocampus_ both fire when someone experiences 
romantic love or when they are addicted to certain drugs
- _Helen Fisher_ called for people to subject themselves to scans who were 
rejected or broke up with loved ones -- the brain scans turned out to be 
similar to those of addicted people (or withdrawal)
- in those situations people show symptoms of withdrawal -- poor judgement etc
- schizophrenia is caused by exuberant release of dopamine into the _Frontal 
cortex_, similar to romantic love
- love and craving is so powerful that it is hardly surprising that crazy 
behavior follows it
- brain scan pictures show activity associated with love in the most ancient 
part of our brain
- _Anterior cingulate_ is also involved in this -- this part is responsible for 
phantom pain as well
- hallucination production is also connected to being in love and rejection
- rising dopamine levels cause serotonin levels to decrease, serotonin is 
responsible for mood, appetite etc (inversely proportional)
- we have SSRIs (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors) as depression 
treatments, now some of them also have dopamine reuptake inhibitors
- _could these be effective for treating unhappy love?_
- _a pill that could "protect" a person from falling in love?_
- activity increases in the romantic core of the brain $\rightarrow$
amygdala deactivates (responsible for fight or flight reactions) $\rightarrow$ 
standards for judging other blur $\rightarrow$ feeling less stress and fear 
$\rightarrow$ unity between the people in love but also risky behavior
- _Globus Pallidus_ is responsible for attachment -- kinda long term love
- Fisher also MRIed people that were in really long-term relationships
and still found dopamine and the Globus pallidus was also active
- other chemicals involved in love: *oxytocin*, *vasopressin*
- those are released during or after orgasm $\rightarrow$ there is no casual 
sex!?
- what is needed to stay together for a long time?
- mirror neurons in the frontal lobe $\rightarrow$ understand the other person
- controlling one's emotions $\rightarrow$ can lead to problems otherwise
- positive illusions (focusing on what one likes in the other person and to 
overlook the ones that you don't like)
- majority of long term couples Fisher studied did not get married
- whether love is very defined and biological or transcends that stuff is not 
totally sure, there are some unresolved mysteries
- seasonal behaviors do play a role in love as they do in depression -- the 
only evidence based factor is sunlight
- differences between love for a partner vs love for friends is in the
Hippocampus -- emotional memories -- parents are slightly different and they
are influences on neuron growth
- love at first sight can biologically exist
- _Anatomy of Love_ and other books by Helen Fisher

# Love as a Social Construct: International Marriages in Kyrgyzstan -- Dr. Ruslan Rakhimov

- lots of debates on international marriages in Kyrgyzstan 
- one guy was beaten up because he was South Asian with a Kyrgyz wife
- not just Westerners meeting Central Asians -- also kind of a clash of
cultures
- guesses of why people talk about this
    - it can be frustrating because there are cultural differences and
    different expectations 
    - some people would want to marry the same ethnic group because they want
    to keep the culture alive
    - there are differences in culture that can lead to a lot of conflicts if
    people don't understand each other
    - the stigma of mail-order brides or just expectations of what a Westerner
    can provide: modernity, wealth, lifestyle, respect, treatment -- being with
    a partner and not a family, here it is often the case that a woman would
    marry a family or clan
- he helped a Kyrgyz-French couple get married and experienced the exchange
- the old NATO base here was kind of a phenomenon, Kyrgyz women got married to
workers and soldies stationed there -- some women were trying to really get
those men
- previous experiences with foreigners is influential
- cultural norms are still strong: women have to get married and before
a certain point, otherwise you are useless, an _old maid_
- it's a psychological travesty
- otherness is a thing -- white Westerners are different and there are a lot of
ideas and expectations attached to that
- _Byproduct Hypothesis_ people share some characteristics
- _Exchange Hypothesis_ people trade characteristics
- e.g. many Kyrgyz ex-Presidents had Russian wives -- politics and not love
- __is international marriage a strategy and not love?__
    - from women and men there are certain expectations and strategies involved
- what if a Kyrgyz guy with the same "cognitive" features as a Westerner came
into the room? Many people say that they would choose a Kyrgyz guy -- __all of
this is a construct?__
- so a Kyrgyz guy could just change to be like a Westerner? Aida thinks yes;
Mathilde thinks it could not be totally Western, but they would still have some
roots -- could be a bonus
- some people would expect that some people (make Kyrgyz) would change by
studying at AUCA for example because you leave and then you are back in the
normal world
- oppression, freedom from traditional norms, they can work if they want to
- also positive stereotypes or romanticized views of Western men
- some people are attached to their culture and thus don't want to be married
to a foreigner because they would need to move here and many would not do that
- they don't want to or can't follow them to their country because of
immigration restrictions
- some people get married to foreigners because they are too old to get married
in Kyrgyzstan and foreigners don't care as much, or this might be just judged
from a local traditional viewpoint
- is there something wrong with Kyrgyz men? do we need to change them?
- Kyrgyz people hold their reputation in high esteem
- Westerners might expect a woman to also work and earn her own money
- some women might not be into that
- people want to be happy in all circumstances, but how that works is different
- of course there are traditional marriages in Kyrgyzstan that follow all the
normal rules and are happy, they don't let the stuff interfere with their
happiness

__Love is a social construct__            

Questions and Discussion

1. Where are the Westerners coming from?
2. What social background do the women that marry foreigners come from?
    - lots of international projects and tourists
    - urbans do not feel the culture as much 
    - might be more from rural areas
3. Kyrgyz families see Russian and Western men as potential spouses -- for some
   time it was acceptable and cool to marry a Russian woman vs Russian men
   marrying Kyrgyz women --- now it is the other way around, foreign men marry
   local women and foreign women don't really marry local men. Another factor
   are the sometimes wildly different expectations about marriage and stuff
   between these two groups. There are different "approaches" to have a "good"
   genealogy with ancestry stemming from a certain place --- mingling with
   non-Kyrgyz is a big problem because of that --- you are ruining the country.
   If a woman "marries up" this is compensated by money
4. Why did Krygyz women marry Westerners? 
    - most of these things are just outside explainers
    - rationalized explanations were often found
    - traditionally there is not freedom -- it is easy to rationalize such a 
    marriage
    - what were the other __actual__ reasons for the marriage
5. What is the Westerners perspective?
    - the mostly agree that the person is the most important thing, but the
    backgound and expectation and culture can be a big issue
    - Mathilde thinks it would be super hard to marry a Krygyz man from a rural
    area because of the social standards that are attached to it
    - American girls thinks that while it doesn't matter in and of itself, 
    there is a ton of effort involved 
    - Canadian thinks that if he finds a person that fits their expectations of
    what kind of person they want to be in a relationship with it would be
    cool, but culture might make this difficult
6. How does all that work with queer communities here? Being queer is a big
   problem here in Krygzystan. It is even a danger. As far a foreigners go,
   there are not a lot of them coming and even fewer of them are queer. Many of
   them probably emigrate to other countries because it is a lot easier. Aida
   remembers a foreign researcher that found a girlfriend in Talas of all
   places

Everyone around the globe wants to find someone -- that's a constant. There are
many hurdles to overcome.

# Love in the Stone Age -- Dr. Aida Abdykhanova

- love in the stone age, but mostly indirect evidence
- it affects all kinds of different aspects of our life
- imaginations of love are probably formed by cartoons etc
- anatomically modern humans can form long term bonds, which is one of the
unique features of humans
- Varieties of views
    - promiscuity (L. Morgan)
    - primitive communism (F. Engels)
    - sex for food (O. Lovejoy)
    - sex contract (H. Fisher)
    - empathy and compassion
    - ability to form a long-term bond
- KNM-ER 1808 died of vitamin A overdose, probably from eating liver
- _Dmanisi_ skull is super old, people at that time were 40 years old at most,
the skull has no teeth (natural causes) so scientists concluded that they person must have
been ~80 years old
- _How Comapssion Made Us Human_ is an interesting book to read
- modern human faces were shaped by (among others) the need for social skills
- more than 20 types of different types of emotions -- our face allows us to
express a wide range of emotions
- how the face shape changed can he clearly seen, this face change went faster
than some other types of biological changes
- footprints of Laetoli are more than 3,66 mya, 1 male, 2-3 females, 1-2
children
- the were Australopithecus africiensis
- the footprints of the child disappear from time to time suggesting that is
was carried
- recently analysis discovered new footprints, might actually be two males and
two small individuals (probably females) and maybe two children
- AL 333 from Hadar, first family ever found, also Australopithecus afrosensis
- many estimations for the number of individuals, 17, 9 adults, 3 adolescents,
5 children
- a paper predicted polygyny in early apes, Ardipithecus, Neanderthals, early
modern humans, but not in Australopithecus
- they used digit ratios to do that so it's not too certain, but cool
- Happisburgh human footprints, a couple adolescents and stuff, about 12
people, from 2 to 18 years
- Ignology studies footprints and the like
- genetic evidence for patrilocal mating behavior among Neanderthal groups,
12 individuals, around 49.000 years ago, Y-chromosome marker and Mitochondrial 
DNA analysis (because it is transmitted to all genders)
- seems to be evidence of cannibalism
- Rouffignac cave A1 in France there are a lot of paintings, but they are also
covered in soft sediment where people drew stuff with their fingers, probably
made by children, one of them was made by a ~5 year old girl
- the paintings are 2m off the ground -- adult picked up the child and helped
it -- kind of like play
- H. sapiens appeared 200,000 years ago, they interbred with Neanderthals and
thus we all have some of their DNA 
- there was also a first generation Neanderthal-Denisovan hybrid found that
gives insight into the interbreeding that happened
- the mother originated in Europe and not in the Altai Mountains
- because of successful interbreeding we have the double taxonomies of Homo
sapiens sapiens and Homo sapiens neanderthalensis
- Sima de los Huesos -- a hole that was used as a grave, 3m meters of sediment
full of bones, 430,000 years ago, 29 individuals have been found, a burial
complex
- the also found a one hand-axe ("Excalibur") that might have been a gift for
the dead
- Shanidar Cave (IV) a 30-35 year old man, lots of flowers, places where
flowers were concentrated, those are considered remedies, maybe Neanderthals
used them as healing items
- the cave has multiple burial places
- Arene Candide cave, 23,500 years ago, a 15 year old boy, he had important
artifacts with him, for example ivory, kauri shells, obsidian tools...
- ivory was from mammoths which were extinct in Europe at the time, obsidian
was from southern France, kauri shells only exist in norther Europe -- exchange
of goods
- the boy may have been killed by a bear or something
- they found stones (pebbles) used to apply ochre to dead people and then being
destroyed the tools 
- they could have also thrown them into fire and the thermal shock could have
destroyed them
- Homo something can form long-term relationship, there were multifamily
groups, there was mating between distinct groups, dead received special
treatment

Questions

1. How long term were the relationships? Hard to say, but probably relatively
long because taking care of children takes time and effort. Parental investment
by males caused high fidelity to them in women, in humans male parental
investment is a lot higher that in other apes. In the stone age families were
relatively small, parental involvement allows offspring to be more fertile and
have more children in their turn
2. the need to express emotions was probably the main drive for the facial
change. One of the things that are studied are the number of muscles that are
needed to make faces. Also the shape of brows and our less prominent eyebrow
ridges make expressions easier
3. Do these kinds of findings exist in Asia or maybe in Kyrgyzstan? There were
some skulls found in a cave here and it disappeared after the scientist that
had it died. In Tashkent a museum has original teeth that nobody can study, and
there are conflicting reports on what that stuff is from. Also some of the
climate here makes some stuff less likely to survive (humidity, acidic soil),
plus just a general lack of investigation
4. In modern animal groups grown up males are forced to leave while in ancient
humans woman were left sometimes and men stayed around. It is super hard to
find any evidence for any of this. There is evidence for matriarchy or
egalitarianism. Biologically, males tend to be more daring and they take their
families along, not like men going out and leaving children and wives behind.
