# WARC Seminar

## Workshop: Finding the source of confusion

- students tend to know more than they think they do
- or they know less than they think they do
- tutors tend to be overzealous when they start tutoring
- they do not connect with the tutee
- _find out what they student understands and what they don't understand_
- make a list of things that they understand and don't understand
- understands: can make concise statements about the topic, can explain it
  accurately, can make new connections between the material and the real
  world/applications
- we need to track down the point where the tutee's understanding fails
- might lead to a student that is dependent on you to figure stuff out
- we have to train students to think about what they understand and do not
  understand -> need to learn what they understand and don't understand
- Comprehension constructor:
    - I am confused by: (write it down)
    - I am confused by: (something from the book)
    - I/We will try to:

- write down stuff a student might think they know, and questions how to check
  if they really do
